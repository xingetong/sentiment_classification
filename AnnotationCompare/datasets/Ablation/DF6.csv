"Few polished maps, there are about 10 maps but only about 4 or 5 of them are completely done the others are still work in progress maps that have yet to be finished",0
"The game is also incredibly poorly optimized,  I run the game on the lowest possible settings and I only get 45-60fps.",0
 but the server is trash. Crashed a thousand times.,0
This is hands down the worst tutorial I have ever played in my entire life (I still can't believe I actually powered through those 3 hours) and ,0
but nothing is brought back to your own game.,0
"That's the real reason why there's no Steam Workshop for NMS - no-one can build anything worth putting in it, and it'd be ALL bases anyway.",0
"If you ignore the fact, it makes my computer scream in agony trying to run it at high graphics settings,",0
"No Newtonian physics, no drifting, ",0
"introducing player-run groups (like guilds that players can make or join and trade or war with other guilds), ",0
"cannot play game without extreme graphics problem, as in having an average fps of 9. ",0
 and quite challenging to deal with,0
If you play permadeath you can literally wind up doing nothing but the tutorial over and over again because you can get killed easily during the tutorial.,0
I also hate that dorms where 100 people live are favourable to single dorm rooms which is the opposite of the real world and took a min to wrap my head around.,0
This has soft locked one of my saves as it now crashes on load up.,0
"So, you googled No Man's Sky and you read all the bad stuff that happened at launch: you think that the game is thrash, fair enough, it used to be this way.",0
the intriguing parts of the story were the surreal sequences and the hints at a larger narrative on the store page and the community hub.,0
"I think that improving the atmosphere would go a long way, adding more dialogue, making the different squad members have personality and banter. So far everything feels muted.",0
 There were some very easy puzzles here and there but mostly it was just clicking and dragging. ,0
the guilt for not having pvp ,0
What a pathetic waste to have billions of planets and not be able to enjoy it with dedicated servers hosting 1000's of players.,0
ruins interaction with other players as it is.,0
I played the new update and it makes me hate this game more than I did the first time I reviewed it.,0
I guess these could be standard for games that use flight stick controllers ,0
"And now after 1,5 hours the credits roll without a real feeling of an ending.so as an adventure game it fails because the riddles are very easy and as a narrative experience it fails because the narrative is nothing special at all.",0
Lots of crashes - ,0
"While it does take a beefy pc to run VR well, and, the experience of a space battle in VR, exploring a planet in VR",0
"it is not perfect however, like when you are going for 3 stars and you are just waiting for time to pass  so you can not doing anything off the wall to test for interesting results.",0
"The ROE (rules of engagement) might be annoying and off-putting to those who are not familiar with SWAT or simulation games at first, but ",0
"Your ship and suit used to have three sections: inventory, tech, and protected storage (a few slots protected from you dying). Simple and had the nice feature that you could put tech items in the inventory space as well to trade carrying capacity for more mobility, shields, etc. No need to worry about that choice anymore. Inventory is inventory and tech is tech and protected storage is gone--just like all your stuff if you die.",0
"needs options for aa methods, post process effects (vignette, dof etc.) instead of putting them all under a few sliders and not knowing that they actually enable/disable for what quality setting?",0
I wish it unlocked the whole map or a few campuses with each level completed because I do not know how big the game is and it would help me decide what to focus on.,0
"The differing game modes add some extra flavour and variance, but they still -feel- almost identical. ",0
"with only vague references to actual diseases,",0
"I like the game but I cannot play it until they fix the saving issue, some of the levels do not save progression and I cannot do other missions because of it.",0
"I like the concept of the superbug network and the global initiatives, but I wish there were a way to complete some of the smaller tasks on your own instead of forcing you to have in-game friends help you complete the projects.",0
"It's just lack of engagement, like a rewarding system that will make people play it again and again. Why don't they give some reward if you beat certain map with certain score? That way, people will strive for that S score and keep playing and learning the game. ",0
"Every time I log in to play now the game freezes or crashes. I have done everything I can to fix update drivers, uninstall and then reinstall, lower the settings, and even follow some online guides. None of it has worked so I am forced to permanently uninstall as it has become unplayable for me.",0
"my graphics for this game are set to very low and the frame rate is still a bit poop, ",0
"when you start each hospital, it is fun for about 20 minutes but then the game goes from intermediate to very very hard very quickly as you become overloaded with incurable dying patients, debt that never seems to go away, and everyone wanting to get promoted at the same time",0
"The camera is very disagreeable. Even after tweaking the settings and modding the game, I was not able to play it without feeling nauseous.",0
only downside is no unlocks everything is given to you good for tactical roleplay but not much else,0
" in general the movement of this game is odd, and I def.",0
"Not because it's challenging in a way that makes sense, usually rather because it's erratic and often unrealistic due to some of the core mechanics being pretty awful.",0
" ""devs spent time to solve its problems"" but I fail every time. ",0
All the options to turn my normal game into a creative mode game cheapens the experience.,0
"if I do get in the red, it does not take long to start building back up and once you do then you build up fast. ",0
"I participated in the game's ""main"" storyline. It's one of those 'pick your bad ending' plots which isn't really worth putting a spoiler alert on. It really is that forgettable.",0
Hands down the game is really really good although I would really love to see more choices/options for customization to weapons and outfits (things to make your operator stand out) ,0
Some screen on text has such bad contrast and disappears too quickly. Low visibility and useless torch that just faces behind you sometimes or turns off randomly meant I fell down into a cave that seemed to only have the one opening in the ceiling.,0
as you travel along being guided by the tutorial which can feel hand-holdy at times but really is only there to get you started.,0
"Excruciating amount of padding. It has the dreaded progress wheel, you know the one I'm taking about, ",0
Initially very frustrating until you learn how to work a space (and the commands),0
"I tried to get a refund, but as I already spent 4 hours in it, I can't have my money back; $40 I regret spending.",0
"very frustrating to play, the mode is too complex, hope the game to be more user-friendly",0
" you've literally ""updated"" it to make said exploration exceedingly more difficult.",0
When has a game is own profanity filter been beat by itself?,0
"Local chat is bad, and it should simply be removed altogether.",0
 there has been a difficulty spike.,0
The crafting system is very unclear and gives little enough guidance to only annoy you. There are just too many innovative solutions that are never explained to the player. Who came up with this save game system that you have to google to understand? ,0
"Other than that, the game lives up to what it was marketed to be. If you do your research before buying this game (or any game) , as you should, you would see the metaphorical small print under where it says ""18 quintillion unique planets"" and that small print says ""procedurally generated"".",0
"Polish it up, fix up all of the script/language issues in the questlines and interaction decisions ",1
"And our winnings weren't by luck, we had to learn from our mistakes. One mistake we learned from was to not bring a CoD player with us. You can imagine why.",1
I'm honestly surprised it’s not more popular as a streaming game but that is also whats probably keeping it as entertaining as it is.,1
"This game is a spiritual successor to theme park hospital world, it was a game made by brofrog back in 1973 for the commadore master system 52, it was considered the greatest game ever made, so good in fact that no one in the history of video games, which goes back a long way, (1918 was the first recorded video game that is a fact) has ever tried to recreate it.",1
"For having 25 hours played on Steam, ",1
"Once you have a grip on survival and travel, perhaps will make some headway into understanding these strange messages and the cosmic forces behind them.",1
With the heavy atmosphere and slow pacing that immediately pumps it to 11 in combat.,1
"The release of No Man's Sky in 2016 was explosive. Developed by indie studio Hello Games, the three years after the game's reveal drew an incredible amount of attention, and in turn, hype. ",1
I turned everything to the highest settings and hopped in creative. ,1
until vr is ready. .,1
"Thought on PVP:maybe 5 operators vs 10 terrorists, they can swap each round.",1
"anyway, this game caught my attention because I have never played hospital tycoon and everyone told you how fun it was.",1
 I have only played  on steam but I have played on xbox and,1
"I'm not a social person tho, so I dislike both options and prefer to remain solo. I'm grateful that option was not removed.",1
this would be cool and big open maps.,1
but there is the occasional space & planet combat encounters that happen naturally.,1
"Bought this on Pre Order, played about 50 hours ,",1
 portrays a current world wherein SWAT police units are called to stop antagonistic and defying circumstances.,1
Suggestions to make the game better: PVP Modes (4v4 maybe) almost like search and destroy without the 360 no scopes.,1
the last few where you've got to reach the center of the galaxy on the higher difficulty levels.,1
"The developers pull no punches in this design, so be warned that ",1
you can see every other player in the game though if multiplayer is enabled and if they are near you/ in the area around you.,1
"Being a difficult game it is,  ",1
I still only recommend this game for 1 player or for a 3-4 group of friends and ,1
"TL/DL No Motion Sickness if set up correctly, and this is with SMOOTH locomotion, not teleport.",1
quick reactions and good planning are vital to survival in this fast (or slow) paced game.,1
"You will be rewarded for methodical teamwork, but punished for rushing or lazily going through the motions.",1
"If you're on the fence, maybe watch some great YouTube videos of full raids. Give you an idea of what you're up against.",1
" tackling epidemics, to handling the balance of budget  ",1
"I enjoyed my first hours in this universe. But after 50-60 hours of playing,",1
"People who never enjoyed / played games from the golden era PS1/2, xbox and PC 99-2005 will never know what they are missing out of.",1
"from someone who has not played very many immersive games, this is my 3rd tactical FPS game I've played the other 2 being ARMA 3 and Insurgency Sandstorm on the PS5, ",1
"AMD Ryzen 5 3600X, Radeon RX 590.",1
when Internet Historian uploaded a video saying that the game was good now.,1
I work in the healthcare system in the UK and ,1
asked for a refund for problems ,1
" I had very few expectations and knowledge about the game other than it being all about exploring strange planets. A few people in my social circle had gotten it, some liked it, some did not, so I got curious and decided to get it.",1
"Update, if you have any overlay on like xbox game bar or game mode, shut those off. They can be a contributing factor if you experience crashes.",1
I really wish to see this game blossom into a true nightmarish realistic tactical shooter. ,1
Anyone who judges the decisions police have to make in microseconds should have to play this game.,1
"After the 4.0 update,",1
Keyboard and mouse controls when it comes to flight in the game are clunky but pairs great with a controller.,1
 Its about being methodical to ensure survive-ability ,1
"but the game is technically still an alpha build, so I’m definitely not complaining.",1
Reviewed on 08/26/2016I will update this review,1
"in addition, the developers made the game as a platform to sell dlcs through. they have tried hard to make the game relevant through in-game events. this is pretty blatant and might look like they are trying to sell the game piecemeal, however the game does have a lot of base content and is time consuming to play (if only because of grinding) and a few items (albeit thematically wrong otherwise) has been released for free over the years.",1
" ""If this game had SC's flight simulation characteristics IT would be the best damn space sim ever!"" Alas while both of these game scratch the itch of Galactic exploration, survival and progression the flight characteristics of NMS are like Pong (for those old enough to know what I'm talking about) compared to SC being a detailed X-Plane commercial airline flight simulation run. However, that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of NMS space battles ",1
"I bought this game as an early access, but I don't get the latest updates. This is only for ""supporters who pays a premium amount of money"". As such it splits the community.",1
"we have discovered a holy chair on the first map that allows you to teleport to the sky realm (Fixed) there        are now Several such items that do this, and I want more -@sometimes your gun just won’t shoot.",1
note I've only played this in single player so far - must be great with a squad of friends).,1
" The dunk Roses are red, Violets are blue. When Harambe died, I did to.",1
"I am a good person really you can believe me look at the plaques which say so. Lot more to cover too - it is a management game in so many aspects - assign staff to particular roles, build and re-build entire sections to utilise the influx of patients, ",1
"In the summer break, you can also take all the time you need to set things up, so running on the fastest speed just lets your staff and students spend all the time they need. ",1
"Oh, yeah, and you can name every planet you discover ",1
"Let it be known, you are only as good as your team and your communication skills with your team. Where I come from, we use call outs such as ""Open door left, closed door right, etc. "" Let your teammates know what you see, even if you don't see anything at all.",1
"I don't have the best rig but on low settings I run arma above 60, RE2 Remake NEVER drops below 70 at near maxed out, DOOM Eternal never drops below 60 and I run med-ultra settings, and I can continue with my other games like KF2, GTA V, etc, but ",1
 it got teased on YouTube.,1
decode and prestige levels are cheatable ,1
In no mans sky you can interact with other players,1
"in my opinion I think it's good to have a lot of topics like “Planes"" that are randomly spawned, with each star having a different climate, such as being very hot from the volcanic star's surface, cold to ice. and almost no living things Or even stars with radiation that will cause our blood to decrease all the time. ",1
"fun and a very straight-forward, breezy sim game. ",2
"customisation of rooms seems to be practically endless due to the number of items in each, and the individuality of certain items.",2
"a single player with some multiplayer aspects, ",2
" The game still needs some polishing, but it has been recently released and they will fox the remaining bugs, balance the game out, add new mechanics and make it even better. ",2
 It's a tiny little puzzle minigame,2
"I do like that the radio announcer is Mark Silk, who did the black and white 'good and evil' voices.",2
this game somehow makes playing a game during a pandemic not depressing and actually quite fun.,2
"no steep learning curve, high skill ceiling,",2
"nowadays its very rare a game catches my attention as much as two point campus has, , and background music/dj that gives some comedy as you play.",2
then two point hospital is definitely worth checking out.,2
if you do not already know it is a hospital simulation game. it is emphasis is more on its humorous aesthetics the strong gameplay mechanics.,2
 then this is a game for you.,2
"mentally sane people. Patience is rewarded As you navigate pitch black hallways and rooms armed with nothing but your guns and a flashlight (NVGs are available too), it really can play out like a horror game. ",2
this still in early acsess is crazy ,2
"This is the first software example of classic science fiction that lets you, via the massive sandbox processes employed, be a full part of the story as it develops.",2
", in doing so you end up learning all about the other parts of the game, you naturally begin to acquire the knowledge and experience that allows you to create the fabled ""Ionised Chicken Egg"" without needing to spend hours on Google.",2
"This game is very fun, I recommend a good headset so you can hear all the drug addicts walking around the house you have to clear and maybe a diaper for when they bust through that door as you’re trying to look under with the mirror gun.",2
"Ready or not is an excellent first person shooter, and ",2
"music it’s simple, peaceful, calming, yet eerie all at the same time.",2
"If spending hours scouring an obscure planet to find one more bizarre lifeform, one more hidden station, one more blueprint tucked away in some terminal can suck you in, ",2
competing against other steam friends for awards at the ceremony,2
this game is a fantastic time sink I really enjoy it I have not played the whole way through and I am definitely taking my time exploring my way through it as a bit of a completionist,2
healthcare is a terrifying and confusing thing but two point hospital also makes it fun.,2
the ability to play online with people and still be able to communicate is a huge upside in my opinion.,2
 love taking photo another planet,2
amzing graphics would recommend this game.,2
"There is a powerful photo mode, and at almost any time during the game you could open the photo mode and take a really nice picture with minimal effort.",2
gathering trophies and platinumed on ,2
plays on both your ability to cooperate and make split second decisions.,2
"The VR is acceptable, ",2
" I think this game is about the sense of scale of the whole thing and if you do see someone else's planet, it’s pretty cool, I have named my planets 2dgamemania.co.uk so people can contact me if they see my planet.",2
the game is fun and the antics keep you wanting to play more,2
overall this game is actually dope.,2
adding a little interactive gameplay,2
 but this game is a breath of fresh air among modern shooters. ,2
"The maps are very atmospheric, and for example my favourite, Neon Club, evokes feelings of almost eerie authenticity",2
settings can be easily adjusted to suit the spec of the computer you are using.,2
"It has been sometime now and  there has been a lot of updates,",2
 This is literally Space Pirate Simulator everything else is just stuff you gotta do for kicks,2
There are some good things about this game which you can read about online,2
"The soundtrack further enhances the sense of wonder and immersion, guiding players through their intergalactic journey with a beautiful and atmospheric score.",2
"boasts an array of realistic tactics, equipment, physics, environments, and firearm mechanics. ",2
" gunplay is on the level of say tarkov, ",2
I can spend a long time just taking photos on a planet.,2
"Watched Twitch streams for a whole week to get a feel for the game, and a weeks’ worth of free drops, including 3 A class hauler ships, 2 A class fighter ships, and 3 A class multitools, plus some neat cosmetics. Then I started playing. And I was hooked.",2
"The ""seasons"" events are a great way to breathe new life into this game and I have done two of them so far. everyone starting on the same world with random equipment and a random ship is awesome, as is everyone having the same planet as a goal.",2
"I used to keep a notepad on my phone that I updated before sleep to what I must do because it felt so satisfying to play that game, I didn't want to lose the momentum.",2
"A nice space exploration game nonetheless,",2
"Whether you choose to follow the main storyline, become a galactic trader, , or simply wander the stars in search of the perfect planet to call home, it's a game that invites players to create their own narrative.",2
 it auto saves so it should only set you back about ten mins,2
"the species unique, the ships totally varied, and no matter what, you can and will always have a different story in the game than anyone else.",2
it was very easy to learn how to play the game but at the same time some of the challenges have been difficult,2
"Normally a game that has this style isn't my type of game, but it looked intriguing",2
"Even if I had completed the game 100%, the updates that the developers had put out since the launch have fixed (in my experience) all the bugs and added SO MUCH content, features and additions to the game that it makes ",2
 when a shooting actually occurs in a dance club in our world.,2
"Besides, the game brings a good atmosphere in missions to players. Sometimes makes you breath rapidly  ",2
it is so worth your time/money if you are into tycoon/building games.,2
 a story driven single player RPG and multiplayer lobby games where people can team up for more difficult content cooperatively.,2
 the people are never typically in the same spots which I love that about it so that it always will pose a challenge.,2
This game is super enjoyable,2
