"deceptive advertising

Today I bought this Square-Trade 4-year ""protection"" plan for a small appliance purchase. The plan expires 4 years from today. The manufacturer provides a one year warranty on the item; thus Square-Trade is really only selling a 3 year extension of the manufacturers warranty. You should call it what it is.",0

"With such great reviews, I was hopeful

With such great reviews, I was hopeful, but this is not a good quality DVD player. The screen looks terribly washed out, even after trying to darken and adjust contrast; the volume doesn‚Äôt go very loud, so it‚Äôs hard to hear in the kitchen (where so usually use my portable player when I‚Äôm baking); and it doesn‚Äôt save you place on the disc when it powers off, so you have to fast forward to get to your spot. Overall, this is very meh. Returning it to find something better.",0
"Even too loud with ear plugs!

Extremely loud, to the point of having to leave the room and the motor has to run excessively long to fill the tank. Have to wonder how it is even legal. The coiled air hose it too tightly formed to be of any use. Might as well just be a short piece of hose. Had I not left it sitting in the box for months before trying it I would have sent it back.",0

Product failure causing low rail pressure, this should not be happening with a fuel filter.",0

I have this a two star because first of all the quality feels very very cheap and the sound is not that good and I lost it the first day I brought it to school and I don‚Äôt regret losing it coz I hate it !!",0

So just got this in the mail, opened it up, charged it for 2 hours. bind it to the phone through the app. Then nothing, it wont track steps, heart rate works for one reading, but one minute it says 93 bpm, the next 48 bpm. I would send it back but would be a waste of time and money to send it back.",0

"Hella disappointed

Where do I start. To say the book was short is an understatement, you can snap your fingers and the book will be over. Not only is the book short there no ending. She just ends the story in Tony and Virginia and goes back to Benjamin Lee. The very few chapters in the book is and that its. In the summary it talks about Tony story, but yet she manged to put a whole section of Benjamin Lee oppose to finishing out Tony story.Save your money this is an incomplete book.",0

Look for another brand I bought 3 for my family and all 3 cracked within a week.",0

"Breaks off of chain

It's very cute and looks just like the picture but it broke off of the chain after only a few months of use and I didn't jerk it. The fan doesn't have a wall switch and therefore requires the chain to function. It's probably fine if you don't pull the chain very often.",0

Half of the letters were torn. Was not able to use.",0

I had liked the while idea as an over the road truck driver that in case of emergencies I can use it. But first initial use of filling up the holding tank, it would leak where the flushing pump is. Complete pissed me off! So, I am trying to fix it myself. That putty that they use doesn't make a complete seal to keep water in. I removed the putty the best that I could and put clear silicone in place if it. Now I will find out if it does not leak.",0
"Only 90 capsules, not 120 as shown. Buyer beware!

It wasnt the right product but I still like it",0
"Waste of money

Definitely not what I thought I was getting. It does not cover as much as the pictures show (and I have a short torso), it rolls down, and didn't smooth or flatten anything. Instead it made me look round and pregnant. I ordered a 3X and you can tell they are made for smaller people, not truly for bigger girls that have a little more to smooth out. Very disappointed.",0

"Worked first time, sheared bolt the second.

I originally bought this in 2016 to tighten a new yoke nut on my motorcycle. It worked fine; I heard the click at the appropriate setting. Not sure how accurate it was but assumed it was good to go based on all the high reviews. Today for the second time in two years, I needed a torque wrench. I‚Äôve had my Tekton stored in a closet in its protective case and at the lowest torque setting as per the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. I needed 10 ft lb torque (the lowest setting on my wrench) to torque two swing arm spools. On the first, it came very close to stripping the bolt, and I never heard a click but decided to stop before it got completely stripped. I blamed myself and assumed I had my allen bit at an angle. On the second spool I slowly twisted the wrench and again, no click. What I did eventually hear was the bolt being sheared in half. I was able to twist the broken half out of the swing arm, but there‚Äôs some damage to the black paint of the swing arm on a 2018 Yamaha R6. I‚Äôm going to try to get the company that makes the spools to send two more bolts, in the event it was their hardware, but I have ordered a different brand of torque wrench to try. I have a feeling it‚Äôs the wrench that caused the issue, as many of the 1 star reviews mention sheared bolts and the wrench not clicking or working for very long. And that makes sense. It‚Äôs $35-40 and made in Asia. If you want a quality mechanics torque wrench you probably have to man up and pay at least $150 for a CDI or $500 for a Snap On. I bought this cause I‚Äôm not a full time mechanic, but I‚Äôd rather not have a torque wrench than have one I can‚Äôt trust to not destroy my vehicles.",0

The rod has rust spotted from one end to the other. It started to rust after about 2 months and just got worse. It's rusted over enough that it's really obvious and ugly.

Disappointing",0
"So so

Not very satisfied with this product",1

Interesting story and semi-detailed descriptions of sweat lodge experiences. The lack of a revenge motive was refreshing. It did seem to be a little juvenile in places but overall an entertaining read.",1

I have small head and did not sit well, I used it because it was for custom and did not have time to change.",1

The colors were cute and girly. Perfect for our 1 year old daughter. The balls are not very sturdy. She is able to squeeze them, I make sure not to crush them if I get in the pit with her. 1 bag is definitely not enough. We bought 3 bags of 200 balls and maybe could have even gotten away with one more.",1

I used for the first time to package individual chicken breasts it was so user friendly and worked with out a hitch. After using it for a few times it does not suck and seal as well as it once did. I plan on calling the manufacturer soon to see if maybe it is defective. Overall, I would still buy it!",1

looks good.. but drips.. I don't know if it's the way it's built or what but it is irritating...",1
"Surprised that it has holes in top cover

I bought this to use in an open 14' boat with a 25HP Honda outboard. The two areas where the cables can go in when the top is tightly fastened with the strap should provide adequate ventilation, but there are two dime-sized grids that are directly open to the rain and/or spray from boating, which eventually would fill and flood the battery box. Not sure why this is designed thus, will just have to check it frequently.",1
"So small

These are soooooo small. Not even sure what size I could order just to cover my bum. Sucks because they are very well made. Order up 2 or so sizes.",1

"Cute, but not practical

This is the cutest bird feeder I own. However, I'm not sure what it is good for. Most sunflower seeds slip right through the mesh, so most fall on the ground. I suppose you could rig up something that would hang under it so that what spills out would be caught. Of course, there are many birds that will find the spillage on the ground and consume it, so all is not lost. It seems to be well made and since I love ladybug beetles, I find it charming. You can spot it across the yard.",1

Not for an active kid. My son had these for less than 2 months and already made holes. Literally can‚Äôt wear them in the rain. To be fair, he drags his feet in the cement while riding his toddler car. The bad part was that it didn‚Äôt take too long for the holes to show up. Not even a couple days of his rough play and he had made holes in them. They are very well made and super cute. Just not for a kid who‚Äôs always playing and dragging around. He‚Äôs just 3 y/o and very active.",1

These only lasted one day at my house. Probably from the kids jumping on them but they worked fine. I will try the old school ones next.",1

Very hard to apply. Gave us a run for our money to try to adhere to sidelight windows. Was a pain in the tail.",1
"A little short for my liking

I ordered this in navy, and the color is as pretty as I expected. It is made of a lightweight, stretchy material, so it fits a little snuggly around the chest and arms. I like the way it flares out without looking like a maternity dress. However, it is a little too short for my liking. It is just at my fingertips when my arms are down at my sides. I almost sent it back for this reason, but decided to just wear it with thicker leggings. It will look nice with a scarf or a long pendant necklace.",1

I can't really fairly review this product as it was damaged when I received it and I could not assemble it due to a bent component. Doesn't look like it happened in shipping. Returned it for refund and went to local Medical supply store.",1
"Comfortable and Cute

T-shirt feel, but comfortable and light. Perfect when it is humid and looking for soft and breathable comfort.",1
"Straps are way to close

Straps are too short even with extending them. The top of the straps are too close to center so they end up rubbing against your neck. The size and bright red color are great. The plastic is very thick which is good so won't tear easily",1
"Battery use

We loved them, but the batteries only lasted about a week and then needed replaced. With over 10 of these, it was going to be expensive replacing the batteries each week or two.",1

"Good on a budget

I wanted to love this mouse I have been very pleased with redragon mice in the past this one sadly falls short of even my logi g502. The second row of buttons are very weak in this they feel worn out and it is new, I am expecting the others to feel the same very soon, the plastic is not like their previous product it feels very cheep in hand, the mode selector is on the bottom so quick access is not there with no way to validate other than opening the software to see what mode your in, finally even though the extra step feels good on the fingers it makes the base so wide if there is any uneven part of your desk it will teeter todder and miss inputs. For the price it is a good piece to test but I would recommend from my expirence paying 20$ more for another brand. Positives it does feel nice in hand even with the cheap plastic, the software is surprising doing well, easy to use and gives you multiple options such as double keying, lastly even though the side buttons need some love to input there are enough buttons to make anyone happy.",1
"A fair read

Fair attempt at telling a story worth telling. I like the introduction of a plausible suspect. Useful information about the nature of policing in the time. Patching writing in places but decent conversational tone throughout. Hard to keep track of all the killings but fair attempt to do that for the reader.",1
"Awkward

Although it is a very cute dress the fit is awkward. I did return it because there was no fixing the way it bulged feom the armpit area to my breast. The semi petticoat was very itchy as well, but fine with a slip. The fabric however was comfy on the skin and had a small amount of stretch.",1

Based on reviews, I decided to try out this Yorkshire blend of black teas. Turned out quite weak after 5 minutes of brewing; with no distinctive flavor or aroma. It was only 3.99 for 100, so its no big loss. We also use tea bags to add color to some curry dishes, and it certainly fits that function.",1
"Three Stars

It's ok - The fabric is not so stretchable for yoga/stretching workouts though.",1
"Better options than these

My dog loves these but they don‚Äôt love her. They make her reflux, upset her stomach and aren‚Äôt organic. Even a minute amount causes lip-licking, yawning and other signs of gastric distress. Tossed the remainder, will never buy again.",1
"Feels pretty good for plantar fascia pain.

Definitely not the magical solution. They are nice because they do not move around much in your shoe and do provide some support and stimulation to the foot. I did think they would be a little more firm so that was disappointing. Overall not bad but I prefer some of longer (3/4 length of your foot) and more stable inserts out there. If the only problem you have is pain in the heel, rather than elsewhere in the foot, these are worth a try and are not overly expensive.",1
"Three Stars

Does not stay charge long enough",1
"Good overall mouse.

I cannot comment on battery life, but overall this device is good. Unlike some cheap air fly mice I used in the past, the mouse pointer of this one moves quite accurately and I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the annoying fact that each time I need to move the cursor across the screen, I need to click the laser pointer button to activate it.",1
"The chair you want to love but hate

I am 5.9 tall, weight 159 pounds, work IT, and sit about 12 hours a day. I have long legs, wear shorts most of the time, and move a lot, so the need for having a flexible chair is a must to have. This chair you need patience, patience, and a good back before you decide to put it together. There are so many small parts and somewhat complicated instructions that lack details. The tools kit that comes with the chair is useless. The wrench slips a lot, so expect to bump your fingers around the chair inners(not a pleasant experience). Once you managed to put it together, adjusting the chair is another headache on its own! This is where I am debating on returning or keeping this chair. There are six knee positions you can adjust this chair, and that is great, but the problem with is that you need to remove a long bolt holding the chair against a wall to stop it from collapsing flat on the growing-risking snapping your fingers-. There's another adjuster that it's designed to adjust the height, you have to get off the chair eyeball it to what you might like, sit and if that does not work, get back off and readjust again. You can't adjust it while sitting unless you have a strong grip, and I lift. In all, this is my first week using the chair, and already feel the benefit of having a knee chair. It helps balance the weight on my lower back. It's very comfortable, feels great moving around my workstation. I will def use it and if I decide to keep it will have to remove bolts to it from scratching me. Notes to the manufactures: 1. adjusters should be improved or made to where anyone can adjust while sitting. 2. the screws and bolt design should be revised. 3. the sitting is too steep, it would be nice that it can also be adjustable.",1
"Worth a read

The book has a lot of good information in it. However, it lacking information. I personally was hoping for more.",1
"Cute but wrong item

The wrong item was shipped. The one I received was darling but I had no need for a random sorority bracelet instead of the one I ordered. The package was returned easily but I miss a Christmas deadline due to the mix-up.",1
"Pretty Small

I know it's my fault for not looking at the dimensions closely enough but this is very small. It does look exactly like the picture, just smaller. It seems to be good quality. I currently have a puppy and am buying small bags of puppy food which fit in this container so it is working okay. Any bigger bags would not fit though. I am a little annoyed as this is the second time I have bought something from amazon that turned out to be small.",1
"Not Suitable

Rubbery and Difficult to use",1

Definitely not for regular use. Good for kids and hot tub only.",1
"Love the product and what it does

Love the product and what it does. I gave it only 3 stars because- The bottle cap popped off during my project and I wasted half the bottle. It was a mess. Thankfully my project wasn't ruined. Disappointed how many times this happened! I was being very carefull I didn't return it due to the inconvenience and hassle returning one small item. Hopefully Ranger reads this review and others. They need to come up with another dabber that works as its supposed to. Thank you for reading-",1

"Just what I needed for a cheap price!

I was required to get this edition for my Music 101 class and can not be more satisfied with the edition. The redeeming factor about this copy was that it is well used. The front cover of the paperback is bent on two of its four corners and the book itself looks well read through with discolored copies. I highly suggest using this if you need to rent a book since it came within a Prime 1 day shipping and arrived in less than 24 hours. Just know it is a used rental book and you are getting the price you paid for, don't expect the new $170 copy.",1
"It‚Äôs ok

It is very dry. Leaves my tan skin with a white look.",1
"really small, really fragile

These are great party hats for cats or really small people. The paper does tear easily, but you can tape the hats up. Don't miss the little adhesives for the pompoms- they are easily lost.",1

"Unpleasant Fragrance

I absolutely can not stomach the smell. I will be giving this product away unfortunately despite the the benefits of the oil. I can not get past the smell.",1
"Overall beautiful

Overall the dress was beautiful the only issue we had was the back was loose so we had to pin it up so that it would not look so loose!",1
"Traps mildew

I was really excited about this bottle since it doesn‚Äôt contain any plastic. It works to hold water and seals well, however, the main problem for me is that it traps mildew very easily and makes it smell bad. I‚Äôve had several other Kleen Kanteen bottles that don‚Äôt do this. I really wanted to like this bottle but due to the mildew smell (and I wash it regularly) it makes me not want to use it.",1
"Hard to hold onto

I use this with my Lenovo Yoga 730. I am a little disappointed because it is very hard to hold onto. It's heavy. It's slides through my hand and the placement of the buttons has me constantly pushing them while writing and trying to hold onto the pen. I tried to put a grip on the pen but that holds the buttons down, so that's not an option. I also don't like that it doesn't flow across the screen with ease when writing. I wish they could've put some more thought into the tip material they decided on so it would be more like writing on paper and not sticky. I just don't think it was quite time to release it.",1
"Pretty

Nice hair but shedded right out of pack",1
"Assembles easy

It was easy to assemble but comes apart easy when you move it. If child or grandchild is tall for their age it is a little short for the age they have as appropriate.",1

"Don't recommend for an iPhone 7

The case is too large for an iPhone 7. If you're okay with the phone sliding around in the case, then this might be for you, but I like the holders to fit the phone more snuggly.",1
"Good product - bad price increase

I am giving this product 5 stars but taking 2 stars away for the constant increase in price each time I have ordered. I am happy with the product but extremely disappointed that each time ordered the price goes up. I posted questioning why only to have it removed. Very sad. Will have to look elsewhere.",1

"Missing fuel filter

Shipping was fast but was missing fuel filter in the kit",1
"Good and bad average out.

They fit me nicely, and sound good to my ears. But, the plug shorted out just shy of eight weeks, so now I have a left-channel earphone (singular), instead of stereo earphones (plural). I'm going to give them another shot and hope the durability improves on the next pair. I also wish I could find something similar with an in-line volume control. I don't need a phone mic, just a volume control.",1
"Okay

Was a bit big but could be worn.",1
"liked the top

Well, I bought this because i thought the top was fun. I am 53 and weigh 125 and I purchased a medium. I wasn't sure about the bottoms and they are a little weird. They fit but the cut is just sorta awkward. Not very flattering on me...but they might be flattering and someone younger. They are cheeky which was fine, it's the weird strap that makes it odd. The top is pretty loose and the bottoms are snug. Bigger bottoms might fit better but then the tops would literally fall off of me. For the price, I am going to keep because I pared the top with different bottoms and it's adorable.",1
"Great to keep you cool

Vacation must have if going to a warm location and you will be out walking in the heat!",2

"Pillow case that give you better skin and less hair breakage? Yes, Please!!

I love, love, love this pillow case. I have had it for a few months now and it has held up beautifully. I bought a silk pillow with the intention of the promised improvement to my skin and hair. Though, it hasn‚Äôt been a miracle cure for hair breakage, I have noticed an improvement in my skin and hair. It also features a zipper closure, which keeps the pillow case from slipping off. The only set back is that you have to take special care when washing, but it is definitely worth it. I also get extremely hot when I sleep and this pillow case has made sleeping much cooler.",2
"This is a great feature.

I tested with items that I have weights for, and the scale was right each time. I did have to play around a bit to zero out after placing a bowl on the scale. This is a great feature..",2

"Great headphone stand

I use this to hold my headphones when I‚Äôm not wearing them, and it‚Äôs also an interesting conversation piece.",2
"Well made and true to color but does not stand up

This is the perfect size and made very well. It just takes a long time to actually hold a shape after unpacking. It does not stand up as shown which is to be expected with it being packed for shipped. It‚Äôs very thick and durable and true to color.",2
"It is confortable

I love it, it is confortable and easy used",2
"Fits perfectly

I love my hat. It seems to be of great quality and it looks really cute.",2
"Super thick and Super Versatile

This wig comes nicely packaged with a wig cap and is super thick; which is crazy considering the price. Such a great deal since it can easily be styled for just about any Harley look.",2
"Great Tongs!

These tongs are amazing! They have a great feel to them and are extremely sturdy! The silicon tips are easy to clean and hold up to high heat with no melting whatsoever. These tongs have a nice weight to them so they are not going to bend when picking up heavier things, such as a heavy pieces of meat. I like that they close and open by pulling/pushing the tab on the end of them. These are well made sturdy tongs and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a nice sturdy well built set of tongs!",2

"In a good way.

Fit as expected. Unexpectedly heavy. In a good way.",2
"Adorable!

Very neat for my First Graders but a little hard to use. They don't mind because this stuff is so popular right now. I use it in my spelling center so they can practice using their spelling words and they have had a blast. Gave 4 stars due to a few spots that have a flaw and it's a little hard to flip on one part of it, where the flaws are, but they love it anyway.",2
"Purple is much better in person than pictured

I'm very happy with this bag. I was hesitant to purchase because the purple in the product picture is very saturated, but I gave it a shot based on the review photos. The purple is perfect, much better in person. The bag is small but it holds the cases for my .40 and 380, plus plenty of boxes of ammo. There's a divider in the middle compartment that keeps the ammo boxes in place. There are 4 pockets around the outside that are spacious, and there's plenty of room in one pocket to hide my extra necessities. The bag is well made and I'd highly recommend it to any person looking for color instead of a basic black bag.",2
"A bit small.

Works fine, but the size: A biggish salad for one or 2 small side salads. Really a bit too small for two, whereas the regular size version is a bit too big. I am goldilocks and I can't find a salad spinner sized to suit...",2

"Good build quality, a bit unwieldy

The material and construction of it is top notch, just a bit large and awkward to grasp and use for a man with fairly short hair to use.",2
"Excellent Value

Really soft and not too heavy. My only criticism is that I would have liked it to be a bit wider. It's probably fine if you just have one person in the bed, but once you get 2 bodies underneath it there's not a lot of extra comforter on the sides. But it's very durable. I bought this as a quickie replacement after a cat puke incident with my old comforter and I'm happy with the purchase.",2

"Different hair styles

I ordered these for my 3 year old niece and my sister has learned a lot of different hair styles.",2
"pretty to wear once in awhile

It is pretty, however, I only gave it a 4 star because, of the sizeing. This ring runs one whole size off. If you wear a size 6 then by all means order a size 7. It does not look like diamonds maybe because, it is not diamonds but, as for costume jewelry it is nice. Will it turn at some point? Probably but, check the price you get what you pay for. All in all not a bad ring.",2
"Resulting smell of the bag not pleasant

The issue I had was they did send a 16inch like I requested. They sent me a 10 inch curly maybe 12 inch ... It took to bleach and coloring very well OVER all the wig is a great wig if you like THAT curly hair .... I would buy this hair again",2

I love the design. It is beautiful. But the cut doesn't really fit in and requires quiet a while to install. The bottom 4 corner patches leave black stains on other stuff, so just be aware.",2
"Really loud!

I like these alarms, I gave one to my daughter, one to my granddaughter and kept one for myself. The noise is REALLY loud and it's easy to pull the cord and set it off, but not so easy that I'm worried that I'll set if off by accident.",2
"Would recommend

lasted longer than the original Lava Lamp bulb I was using..",2
"Almost to good...

I love this Mic for recording rap and pop vocals, but be extremely careful on how your using it with your home studio setup. Its almost to sensitive. You can literally hear birds chirping outside and the sound of the air circulating in the room. Can be a good thing or a bad thing, as long as you make sure you plan ahead and make the correct setting adjustments and use a high pass filter. Some great plug ins that can help with that as well. Also, make sure this is the right mic for you in terms of the type of vocals you plan on recording. I use it for pop and rap vocals, which to me sound great, but others have advised against.",2
"Not exactly hypo allergenic.

Still have eye irritation when using but not as bad as the store brands.",2
"Works well, but you'll need to stabilize the bottom

It keeps my leash chewing dog in the back seat. I had to add an extra bungee cord in the middle bottom to stablize it. Otherwise it is only attached to headrests and the dog would be able to squeeze underneath the middle by pulling it back. I put it around the center console and it works perfectly.",2
"If your reading this that meaning your getting married... So congrats!!

"works well!

This bey comes in three parts (top, center, and bottom) and is meant to explode (hence beyblade BURST). Good quality, and comes with a string launcher (launcher with retractable string pull). This beyblade ONLY WORKS with included launcher or any other LEFT spinning launchers (but be careful not to over pull the string, it WILL break! It can be repaired with a phillips head screwdriver, so dont worry if it does). It is the ONLY left spinning beyblade released atm which is good for competitions. It is meant to steal the opponents spin. Stickers are included to apply yourself. This bey looks incredible, but takes a while to get used to.",2
"Adorable

The socks are adorable-the only thing is the glitter on the bottom was not as bright as the picture. The glitter writing was dull.",2
"Love these! Shoes but not!

Love these! Our son is 4 months old and although he is in the slightly larger size for his age I went ahead and got a bigger size and went with the 12-18 month size. It‚Äôs not like he is using them to walk around so even though they are a little bigger the size works out... then I won‚Äôt have to buy a new pair when he out grows them next month lol. They are like shoes but not. They work out great when he‚Äôs in his exersaucer. It‚Äôs a little chilly out right now so they work out great for the season! I can wait till he starts walking... when that time comes this will probably work out great! The buttons and elastic do great at holding them on his feet",2

"Perfect for home espresso bar

Well packed. Arrived in a nice box suitable for gifting. Look great in my home coffee bar. Unfortunate that people are leaving negative reviews on this product based on the size which is clearly listed in the description. If you are looking for a regular sized coffee mug, this is not what you are after. These are small espresso cups. Don't down vote a product because you ordered it without understanding what you were ordering.",2
"Better size options would be gr8

My hair is about two feet long and I have a pretty big head. A couple of the reviews on here sounded promising that the towel would be able to hold all my hair. Unfortunately, it does not. About 6 inches still hangs out (and even then that's not covering the roots of my hair very well). HOWEVER, it dries my hair REALLY well. Like so well, that the hair that doesn't fit in the towel doesn't bother me once I take all my hair out of the towel. I've only used it twice now, so I can't yet comment on if it is keeping my hair strong, but so far my hair doesn't feel worse. If they ever sell a normal size of this towel I'll definitely buy it.",2
"Great massager

"Best carryon solution I have found

This bag fits nicely under the seat or at your feet in the car. It has multiple pockets for easy access to your phone, water bottle, etc. The interior of the bag holds make-up, medical supplies, books, etc. It's deceivingly ""large"" due to it's configuration and pockets. I am not searching or fumbling for items, therefore, not annoying the person sitting next to me. Best of all it has a built-in strap at the back, so it slides right on top of another suitcase or carry-on.",2
