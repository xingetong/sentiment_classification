 portrays a current world wherein SWAT police units are called to stop antagonistic and defying circumstances.,1
 my previous issue with there being bit too much focus on just getting lucky occasionally also ,1
 There were some very easy puzzles here and there but mostly it was just clicking and dragging. ,0
"much like two point hospital,",1
Things I wish will come with updates: - manual scheduling of classes to specific rooms. - allow training and upgrading during summer break. or at least enable the player to schedule training for a staff member.,0
" I can safely say that the game has fulfilled my expectations to what it has to offer this early on, which is a Co-Operative Tactical SWAT game with multiple methods of completing the tasks given, however has very little to offer",1
 some of the mouse-over icons do not have tooltips while others do.,0
 that is that it still feels a little bit lonely out in space despite there being a ton of fun NPC's.,0
I'm honestly surprised it’s not more popular as a streaming game but that is also whats probably keeping it as entertaining as it is.,1
"Ready or not is an excellent first person shooter, and ",2
"This game is so realistic,",2
 but the server is trash. Crashed a thousand times.,0
"I participated in the game's ""main"" storyline. It's one of those 'pick your bad ending' plots which isn't really worth putting a spoiler alert on. It really is that forgettable.",0
"The optimisations taken to allow such a vast universe to be rendered are quite apparent though, with obvious texture pop-in, very inconsistent framerates, and limited render distances, which did put a bit of a damper on the experience.",0
"Local chat is bad, and it should simply be removed altogether.",0
" ""If this game had SC's flight simulation characteristics IT would be the best damn space sim ever!"" Alas while both of these game scratch the itch of Galactic exploration, survival and progression the flight characteristics of NMS are like Pong (for those old enough to know what I'm talking about) compared to SC being a detailed X-Plane commercial airline flight simulation run. However, that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of NMS space battles ",1
"I do not like the new UI, and preferred the style of two point hospital and it had more text buttons which I find easier to recognize than all icons.",0
Very fun with friends. We spent like half an hour messing around with the different weapons in the lobby and the mechanics are awesome.,2
" When these issues are fixed I will be happy to come back to this review and update it with a glowing, no strings attached recommendation, until then…",2
"The camera is very disagreeable. Even after tweaking the settings and modding the game, I was not able to play it without feeling nauseous.",0
"a single player with some multiplayer aspects, ",2
In 9 hours of gameplay ,1
 it got teased on YouTube.,1
"No Newtonian physics, no drifting, ",0
I also hate that dorms where 100 people live are favourable to single dorm rooms which is the opposite of the real world and took a min to wrap my head around.,0
Re-visiting 5 years later after launch. ,1
"I used to keep a notepad on my phone that I updated before sleep to what I must do because it felt so satisfying to play that game, I didn't want to lose the momentum.",2
Anyone who judges the decisions police have to make in microseconds should have to play this game.,1
"The release of No Man's Sky in 2016 was explosive. Developed by indie studio Hello Games, the three years after the game's reveal drew an incredible amount of attention, and in turn, hype. ",1
"This game is great! This is a real ""Spaceman Simulator""!",2
"While it does take a beefy pc to run VR well, and, the experience of a space battle in VR, exploring a planet in VR",0
"There is no support for Joysticks, only gamepads.",0
"Most games that use VOIP suffer similar issues so I tend to stick to discord or other VC platforms, but this game seems to vary from whispers to screams when it comes to other player's voice levels. this might just be more of My experience than anything, but If you are trying to toss a nade into a room you peeked open, Good luck.",0
"it is not perfect however, like when you are going for 3 stars and you are just waiting for time to pass  so you can not doing anything off the wall to test for interesting results.",0
 I have only played  on steam but I have played on xbox and,1
it is so worth your time/money if you are into tycoon/building games.,2
"I tried to get a refund, but as I already spent 4 hours in it, I can't have my money back; $40 I regret spending.",0
"This is also the first game brought out by two point games and seeing the reviews, its pretty dang good!!",2
There are some good things about this game which you can read about online,2
"It's worth a play through but the endgame is limited, ",0
quick reactions and good planning are vital to survival in this fast (or slow) paced game.,1
you will need to learn in order to progress and not just illness discovery,1
" their spawns change with every round, and not in a predictable pattern, they'll rush you when you least expect it, pull a knife on your if you're not paying good attention while they're surrendering, blind fire through doors and glass if they hear you prepping a breach, and basically do anything they can to catch you off-guard.",1
 and quite challenging to deal with,0
"no steep learning curve, high skill ceiling,",2
"mentally sane people. Patience is rewarded As you navigate pitch black hallways and rooms armed with nothing but your guns and a flashlight (NVGs are available too), it really can play out like a horror game. ",2
"I needed 10 hours to get through the tutorial mission because, crashes, corrupted save files and no existing dialogue options.",0
The Building System is shallow and it’s not possible to make your own vehicles or at least customise them significantly.,0
amzing graphics would recommend this game.,2
"You will be rewarded for methodical teamwork, but punished for rushing or lazily going through the motions.",1
there is not much more interesting content to do.,0
"with only vague references to actual diseases,",0
"In the summer break, you can also take all the time you need to set things up, so running on the fastest speed just lets your staff and students spend all the time they need. ",1
" as does the Quest 2 headset itself, as well as the Quest Link -> PC. Not seeing any performance drops to this degree when playing around with SteamVR by itself, therefore indicating the source of the issue with No Man's Sky itself.",0
even build a Meka for yourself.,1
"Thought on PVP:maybe 5 operators vs 10 terrorists, they can swap each round.",1
 the flying controls have you actually grabbing the throttle and stick.,1
"the sound for this game is really good, guns feel nice and punchy also being able to hear the people through the walls preparing for you is a nice touch.",2
I wish it unlocked the whole map or a few campuses with each level completed because I do not know how big the game is and it would help me decide what to focus on.,0
" in general the movement of this game is odd, and I def.",0
but nothing is brought back to your own game.,0
"It was the greatest disappointment I ever faced in a game when it launched in 2016, but now I consider it to be the biggest redemption story in the history of gaming.",0
"My favourite part of this game is finding something new and amazing, or finding a new planet with amazing resources, It is like getting to live your dream over and over again in a Groundhog Day, open world environment.",2
" ""devs spent time to solve its problems"" but I fail every time. ",0
A game that had a rocky start ,0
"First, I did not preorder the game, nor did I pay a lot of attention to it while it was in development, therefore, I do not have that feeling of having been cheated that some other reviewers seem to have.",1
"There is a powerful photo mode, and at almost any time during the game you could open the photo mode and take a really nice picture with minimal effort.",2
 to name my discovered species,1
"Every time I log in to play now the game freezes or crashes. I have done everything I can to fix update drivers, uninstall and then reinstall, lower the settings, and even follow some online guides.

"People who never enjoyed / played games from the golden era PS1/2, xbox and PC 99-2005 will never know what they are missing out of.",1
I guess these could be standard for games that use flight stick controllers ,0
if you do not already know it is a hospital simulation game. it is emphasis is more on its humorous aesthetics the strong gameplay mechanics.,2
"had issues when I first picked up this game. per developers troubleshooting, I excluded folders from antivirus, re-installed graphics card, and re-verified game files. spent almost an hour in game and it no longer crashes and seems to be running smooth. am now a happy gamer again.",2
"that is mainly to support the game in its development when the game is worked on by an indie team. Best of all, they don't try to sell you dumb skins/NFTs for the game, or any Pay 2 Win things like other multibillion companies do.",2
Keyboard and mouse controls when it comes to flight in the game are clunky but pairs great with a controller.,1
"I was just wondering if you guys could just put a label on the star systems if they are red, green, yellow or blue. It's a bit hard to discern for color blind people like me. I know I’m asking much but I just love this game too much.",0
only downside is no unlocks everything is given to you good for tactical roleplay but not much else,0
"For having 25 hours played on Steam, ",1
and AI camping in blind spots did make me jump off my seat.,2
rely solely on valve is steamworks anti-cheat and copy protection system for this game.,1
"but the game is technically still an alpha build, so I’m definitely not complaining.",1
overall this game is actually dope.,2
"I like in games to make decisions, plan things, have some strategy, accomplish things and learn how to play better.",2
engage in space combat,1
" I had very few expectations and knowledge about the game other than it being all about exploring strange planets. A few people in my social circle had gotten it, some liked it, some did not, so I got curious and decided to get it.",1
" you've literally ""updated"" it to make said exploration exceedingly more difficult.",0
"Being a difficult game it is,  ",1
"I have played two point hospital and, while a realize that ",1
"After the 4.0 update,",1
" I think this game is about the sense of scale of the whole thing and if you do see someone else's planet, it’s pretty cool, I have named my planets 2dgamemania.co.uk so people can contact me if they see my planet.",2
"boasts an array of realistic tactics, equipment, physics, environments, and firearm mechanics. ",2
Initially very frustrating until you learn how to work a space (and the commands),0
 It's a tiny little puzzle minigame,2
"Let it be known, you are only as good as your team and your communication skills with your team. Where I come from, we use call outs such as ""Open door left, closed door right, etc. "" Let your teammates know what you see, even if you don't see anything at all.",1
This has soft locked one of my saves as it now crashes on load up.,0
"I am a good person really you can believe me look at the plaques which say so. Lot more to cover too - it is a management game in so many aspects - assign staff to particular roles, build and re-build entire sections to utilise the influx of patients, ",1
"I'm not a social person tho, so I dislike both options and prefer to remain solo. I'm grateful that option was not removed.",1
"It can be a relaxing experience with fairly good immersion, nice and colorful and ",2
I could run instead of walking everywhere,1
testing yourself and teammates in different 'problems',1
"I was placed on a planet that was -55 temperature, but just trying to survive long enough became a chore. Tried again, and again, and again etc. Every planet is either -55, +55, or has a toxicity level of 60. Which in itself COULD be overcome except… So survival was based on luck and not skill.",0
"I don't know what's changed in recent updates, ",0

it was very easy to learn how to play the game but at the same time some of the challenges have been difficult,2
this still in early acsess is crazy ,2
I played the new update and it makes me hate this game more than I did the first time I reviewed it.,0
really hits the right spot in the sim and management game genre about a hospital,2
you can see every other player in the game though if multiplayer is enabled and if they are near you/ in the area around you.,1
"This is a serious tactical shooter for serious, ",1
"Perhaps a saving mechanic for single player might help with the longer maps, but limit saving to twice or three times to really make players gamble.",0
"The game is also incredibly poorly optimized,  I run the game on the lowest possible settings and I only get 45-60fps.",0
"This isn't so bad, but their AI design especially in sound is what makes them seem too smart.",0
"Excruciating amount of padding. It has the dreaded progress wheel, you know the one I'm taking about, ",0
"And our winnings weren't by luck, we had to learn from our mistakes. One mistake we learned from was to not bring a CoD player with us. You can imagine why.",1
"This game makes you feel like a kid again, where your curious mind takes you afar and wide, ",2

 it auto saves so it should only set you back about ten mins,2
"nowadays its very rare a game catches my attention as much as two point campus has, , and background music/dj that gives some comedy as you play.",2
RoN has made and balanced it in such a way that is easy to understand and sufficiently consistent.,2

When I open up a menu the left thumb stick does not work at all. I am supposed to go to the next page with R1 but will only work with R2. I tried to do everything support told me. Change the bindings to custom then back. Uninstall/Reinstall. Tried remapping myself. Tried going into steam controller settings and changing it to the original bindings. Nothing works.,0
 a story driven single player RPG and multiplayer lobby games where people can team up for more difficult content cooperatively.,2

"fun and a very straight-forward, breezy sim game. ",2
this game is a fantastic time sink I really enjoy it I have not played the whole way through and I am definitely taking my time exploring my way through it as a bit of a completionist,2
" The dunk Roses are red, Violets are blue. When Harambe died, I did to.",1
"With the addition of photo mode stuff,",1
you'll be lead into the game will be shocked at how STEEP the learning curve is.,0
"my graphics for this game are set to very low and the frame rate is still a bit poop, ",0

This is hands down the worst tutorial I have ever played in my entire life (I still can't believe I actually powered through those 3 hours) and ,0

It's very ruff around the edges when it comes to the physics of gravity and other animations.,0
 as well as different difficulty levels to cater to different playstyles.,1
"This game is a spiritual successor to theme park hospital world, it was a game made by brofrog back in 1973 for the commadore master system 52, it was considered the greatest game ever made, so good in fact that no one in the history of video games, which goes back a long way, (1918 was the first recorded video game that is a fact) has ever tried to recreate it.",1

"Oh, yeah, and you can name every planet you discover ",1
competing against other steam friends for awards at the ceremony,2
Some screen on text has such bad contrast and disappears too quickly. Low visibility and useless torch that just faces behind you sometimes or turns off randomly meant I fell down into a cave that seemed to only have the one opening in the ceiling.,0
"Not because it's challenging in a way that makes sense, usually rather because it's erratic and often unrealistic due to some of the core mechanics being pretty awful.",0
"And now after 1,5 hours the credits roll without a real feeling of an ending.so as an adventure game it fails because the riddles are very easy and as a narrative experience it fails because the narrative is nothing special at all.",0
"Even if I had completed the game 100%, the updates that the developers had put out since the launch have fixed (in my experience) all the bugs and added SO MUCH content, features and additions to the game that it makes ",2
This game is super enjoyable,2
"in my opinion I think it's good to have a lot of topics like “Planes"" that are randomly spawned, with each star having a different climate, such as being very hot from the volcanic star's surface, cold to ice. and almost no living things Or even stars with radiation that will cause our blood to decrease all the time. ",1
"Whether you choose to follow the main storyline, become a galactic trader, , or simply wander the stars in search of the perfect planet to call home, it's a game that invites players to create their own narrative.",2

 Its about being methodical to ensure survive-ability ,1
The crafting system is very unclear and gives little enough guidance to only annoy you. There are just too many innovative solutions that are never explained to the player. Who came up with this save game system that you have to google to understand? ,0

 despite visually looking like it can.,1
"P. s.: if you ever feel the need to preorder a game before release, stop and think for a second: maybe it's better to wait for launch day and see if the hype was justified - or if the game itself is playable at all. If nothing else, as the title of a much beloved sitcom remarks, curb your enthusiasm.",1
and there was zero training on how to play this.,0
"Your ship and suit used to have three sections: inventory, tech, and protected storage (a few slots protected from you dying). Simple and had the nice feature that you could put tech items in the inventory space as well to trade carrying capacity for more mobility, shields, etc. No need to worry about that choice anymore. Inventory is inventory and tech is tech and protected storage is gone--just like all your stuff if you die.",0
the game is fun and the antics keep you wanting to play more,2
"There is a variety of maps but with mods you can massively increase that. Mod support is good as well with people being able to make all sorts from uniforms, guns, voices, menu mods etc.",2

"in addition, the developers made the game as a platform to sell dlcs through. they have tried hard to make the game relevant through in-game events. this is pretty blatant and might look like they are trying to sell the game piecemeal, however the game does have a lot of base content and is time consuming to play (if only because of grinding) and a few items (albeit thematically wrong otherwise) has been released for free over the years.",1

"Fair warning, there was a bit of motion sickness I noted after playing, which was also noted by other players, hopefully this won't affect you.",0
making it so that running and gunning simply does not work in most cases (there's no sprinting either).,0
"such likes is plenty when you are not out exploring on foot or tucked away in your ship, arcing around another planet for more asteroids to mine. ",2
It has a better user interface then two point hospital. ,2
"music it’s simple, peaceful, calming, yet eerie all at the same time.",2
"This is the first software example of classic science fiction that lets you, via the massive sandbox processes employed, be a full part of the story as it develops.",2
"This whole time, trying to launch the game resulted in the UE4 prerequisites installer opening and hanging at 0% again, needing to do the steam cloud trick to bypass the installer and launch the game to even see if one of my attempted fixes for the FRS setting worked. Then I had to figure out how to bypass the first time setup requirement every single time the game was launched.",0
"played the original game back in the 90s, this remake of a classic is so much fun with ",1

"just reviewed this game, if your cba about reading all the community reviews check out my video review here",1
when Internet Historian uploaded a video saying that the game was good now.,1
"I enjoyed my first hours in this universe. But after 50-60 hours of playing,",1
Reviewed on 08/26/2016I will update this review,1
Have not even played the game yet but #PrayForHarambe,1
"needs options for aa methods, post process effects (vignette, dof etc.) instead of putting them all under a few sliders and not knowing that they actually enable/disable for what quality setting?",0
All the options to turn my normal game into a creative mode game cheapens the experience.,0
"A nice space exploration game nonetheless,",2
", in doing so you end up learning all about the other parts of the game, you naturally begin to acquire the knowledge and experience that allows you to create the fabled ""Ionised Chicken Egg"" without needing to spend hours on Google.",2
for a game that's still under early access,1
"So far this game has a lot of potential, with the support of the mod community,",2
" in addition, the rooms can be designed with great attention to detail, and the game gives you the feeling that it was not in vain and ",2
the game is enjoyable. some issues are that once you get into higher levels it gets very difficult. sometimes the emergencies they give you is almost impossible to complete with the time given. ,0
"with campus, I will probably be 100% complete by next week. ",1
"the games always full of fresh figures and keeps the experience fresh and new since everyone’s different playstyles are gonna clash, ",2
Pretty much every option I would desire is in there. You can change difficulty of enemies. You can change damage done to you and your ship. Several other options as well.,2
all you can do is micromanage the settings to increase difficulty.,1
adding a little interactive gameplay,2
"I heard my friend who did buy it say he got burnt out on it, and after it is release, I watched a couple people on YouTube reviewing the game, basically saying it was incomplete.",0
"GREAT amount of bugs. This game should be named ""dumb ways to die because of bugs"".",0
"The VR is acceptable, ",2
"No server browser, and (even when steam charts says 4000 players online) no matches found (east coast USA).",0
"Watched Twitch streams for a whole week to get a feel for the game, and a weeks’ worth of free drops, including 3 A class hauler ships, 2 A class fighter ships, and 3 A class multitools, plus some neat cosmetics. Then I started playing. And I was hooked.",2
"discovering new diseases and treatment rooms,",1
The company actually fixed their reputation and game.,2
The only use I found for it is using it in photo mode for pretty sci-fi space pictures.,2
Game is pretty cool and all,2
the last few where you've got to reach the center of the galaxy on the higher difficulty levels.,1
"a few wish list items include - multiple stories, greater than a few hundred students, more building facade elements and styles, instead of several map locations have several campus locations. cars, trucks, parking, loading dock ? there is potential to add so many things with comic story line.",0
"The AI is similar to that of SWAT 4 and with familiarity,",1
I almost have 100 hours in this game.,1
until vr is ready. .,1
What a pathetic waste to have billions of planets and not be able to enjoy it with dedicated servers hosting 1000's of players.,0
Absolutely awesome game feels so tense,2
"That said, I've enjoyed playing in single player mode and have accumulated ",2
"But there is one inexcusable and infuriating issue - if it detects a controller, it forces you to use it! There is no menu item to switch back to mouse and keyboard. this is insane! because of my setup [my fault] every time I unplug my controller, and want to use it again, I have to restart my personal computer - so now, every time I want to play this game, I will have to do that. Fix this immediately!",0
"It creates a culture of excuses, Stockholm syndrome and worst of all; a lack of accountability on the part of developers ESPECIALLY the big AAA studios -see Cyberpunk 2077.",0
"If spending hours scouring an obscure planet to find one more bizarre lifeform, one more hidden station, one more blueprint tucked away in some terminal can suck you in, ",2
"cannot play game without extreme graphics problem, as in having an average fps of 9. ",0
 I would recommend this game for everyone.,2
then this game is for you.,2
then two point hospital is definitely worth checking out.,2
I have about 500h ,1
" Of course, it is a remake of an old classic, but it has upgrades, new additions and a fun narrative that makes it feel very much like it is own game.",2
"I only want bugs to be ironed out, and more content, because the game did become thin very quick, but",0
"This game is very fun, I recommend a good headset so you can hear all the drug addicts walking around the house you have to clear and maybe a diaper for when they bust through that door as you’re trying to look under with the mirror gun.",2
"The maps are very atmospheric, and for example my favourite, Neon Club, evokes feelings of almost eerie authenticity",2
"Bought this on Pre Order, played about 50 hours ,",1
"I think that improving the atmosphere would go a long way, adding more dialogue, making the different squad members have personality and banter. So far everything feels muted.",0
"It's just lack of engagement, like a rewarding system that will make people play it again and again. Why don't they give some reward if you beat certain map with certain score? That way, people will strive for that S score and keep playing and learning the game. ",0
asked for a refund for problems ,1
I first discovered this game years ago. ,1
"gun-play is punchy, responsive, satisfying as hell.",2
"The last aspect is the most important in this type of game, I’m really serious, it feels like being inside the action in every moment of the game, you'll experience fear, anger, concussions",2
"after 10-15 hours of gameplay,",1
"Besides, the game brings a good atmosphere in missions to players. Sometimes makes you breath rapidly  ",2
gathering trophies and platinumed on ,2
I found it better with friends through discord chat and in-game chat some do not talk or starting having communication issues only hearing one player. ,0
"The orientation of an item is always by default, so if you have to add 10 bench in an other direction you have to rotate all of them with a mouse movement (while you have pressed a mouse button); this mechanic is just insane and very annoying. they could simply memorize the last orientation positioned of any item and replicate so save you minutes of very repetitive operations (that you have to arrange and rearrange for every single hospital). ",0
like in Escape from Tarkov ,2
"I don't have the best rig but on low settings I run arma above 60, RE2 Remake NEVER drops below 70 at near maxed out, DOOM Eternal never drops below 60 and I run med-ultra settings, and I can continue with my other games like KF2, GTA V, etc, but ",1
When has a game is own profanity filter been beat by itself?,0
"The ROE (rules of engagement) might be annoying and off-putting to those who are not familiar with SWAT or simulation games at first, but ",0
"overall, the gameplay is solid a few small bugs that make, mechanics are amazing",2
"If you're on the fence, maybe watch some great YouTube videos of full raids. Give you an idea of what you're up against.",1
 Like a progression system maybe where we could start out with nothing but a few pistols to choose from and better gear comes from rank / skill / challenges / in game currency.,0
"What do you have? To familiarize yourself with the game Ready or Not offers a Training Room from which you start missions, shoot yourself through a killhouse and get familiarized with Ready or Nots mechanics.",2
 This is literally Space Pirate Simulator everything else is just stuff you gotta do for kicks,2
NMS has a deep story and might actually provide a valuable lesson in computer morality.,2
"Not to mention that the game is actually somewhat difficult, there are times where it can be very easy or just feel like you were unlucky ",1
"All of my friends and I also have issues with lag/graphics as we don't have very good computers to run the game very well, this game for me runs around 30/60 fps on most maps and sometimes even down to 20 on lowest graphics with AMD fidelity on.",0
somewhere I could ease the tensions of being a final semester college student,1
"You will make your story, your world, and your character all your own through hours of pondering and intrigue as you learn the languages to communicate and the skills to travel.",1
"then doing it all over again after it crashes,",0
"when you start each hospital, it is fun for about 20 minutes but then the game goes from intermediate to very very hard very quickly as you become overloaded with incurable dying patients, debt that never seems to go away, and everyone wanting to get promoted at the same time",0
I really wish to see this game blossom into a true nightmarish realistic tactical shooter. ,1
 just moving from console to PC,1
do not make it competitive  ,0
