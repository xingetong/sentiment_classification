"I really want to like No Man's Sky, but every time they push an update I get a fleeting moment of excitement until I quickly learn they fail to deliver on the basics, ",0
only complaint have is the randomness of the symbols and items once had run with tombs and urns but without anything that can destroy them or that synergies with spirits wish symbols and items would be either automatically rigged little towards your synergies could be rigged by the player with luck statistic that other None can increase synergy capsule or different type of rare currency with which you could even possibly choose the symbol you want the next symbols to synergize with,0
"What I have realized through thinking more about this game is that it is not necessarily bad, but extremely bland. The story is uninspired and shallow.",0
"Planets feels repetitive, having jumping from two or five for a newcomer feels really great, but when you spend more time and the planets number goes up, its get boring real fast. .I mean, ",0
"Even the starting ship, with basic gear, can handle most space threats, including battling several pirates or a full sentinel threat, with relative ease.",0
The introduction is painfully terrible and dumps so much info on me that I absorb none of it and I only progress because the game tells me exactly what to do.,0
"Some things are way TOO LOUD and others TOO quiet. The overhead non-stop ships and over-the-top storms are deafening. The game desperately in need of ""Private Air Space Area"" function to prevent this.",0

two point hospital is a shallow room spam to cope with the ever-increasing hordes of patients,0
 but it is frustrating that in VR my 1080ti ,0
"Game felt too restrictive for my taste, also controls like fov is surprisingly restrictive and you can't seem to change first person fov, kinda disappointed I can't crash my ship into a planet.",0
don’t care if this is server sided or player sided because people got CR/-\PPY internet connections but even with my 500/500Mbit Fiber connection people are just one big pile of pixel laggers!,0
"This game may be full of bugs, ",0
"I play multiplayer with a SINGLE other person and despite how far this game has come in the way of updates (which has been mostly great), the game still crashes unexpectedly especially when going to the options menu for some reason and I",0
there was very little challenge.,0
The AI can do a full rotation in 0.1 seconds and shoot you down with 100% accuracy and ,0
 but the finer textures tend to pop or straight up use the lowest res version in some cases (usually npc faces),0
"Night vision is not correctly modelled (no peripheral vision) and is a tad too bright in some places, just perfect in others so it becomes impractical to bring on missions where there is a lot of darkness but a light in the house is on.",0
"you cannot get 100% achievements (as of 2-19-2020), due to needing friends to do parts of your superbug initiatives, in their own hospital. tips: it is indeed a balancing act between having the right amount of general practitioners’ offices, diagnosis rooms and treatment rooms.",0
"CONS: The game is, for the most part, almost completely silent with little music. ",0
"When I reviewed it first, I said I really really liked it but gave a negative review cause of the lies.",0
"Very hard to do some micromanagement tasks you are familiar with from other games, limiting staff to one activity is done on a staff-by-staff level with numerous clicks.",0
The tactical FPS genre seriously needed its standards raised.,0
An excellent tactical shooter that ,0
"maybe I do not know the hotkeys/easier ways to do it, but queue management could be better (when you want to choose a bunch of people to kick out of the hospital). a button to kick or send to treatment while looking at the queue list would be great.",0
"The audio is repetitive, same sounds and music’s over and over, and adds nothing to the gameplay.",0
"within the main campaign, barely any combat and it hardly incentivises adventure.",0
lack of a voice tutorial poor and not a great intro to the game.,0
 but I am unable to continue playing it because the crashing issue I do not want to refund the game but feel might as well due to not being able to play it.so keep this in mind if your going to buy this game as you might not get to go past the first hospital :(,0
and they do not come close to those used in theme hospital.,0
"Every star system is the same - 2-5 (single biome) planets with no real diversity or relation to one another, ",0
"This game is an inch-deep ocean with nothing visible on the horizon, a silent and monotonous waste of your precious time.",0
"no difficulty settings, very confusing and not user-friendly customization options, no explanations of anything, I can keep going.",0
the tutorial did not explain a lot of features so that was very confusing.,0
single player mode needs something better than the old system form swat4 almost 20 ¥ years ago.,0
 isn’t blowing my hair back with graphics or AI interaction and voice lines.,0
"It's frustrating not being able to hit anything because there's no rollback. I have to predict and lead every shot I take, and it's near impossible in maps full of cover. I'd essentially only be able to push in with the shield while he shoots for me.",0
"If you managed to survive not getting shot by a random enemy AI that spotted you through a miniscule gap in a wall, well done, ",0
"everything way more likely to spontaneously break, and you'll probably soon wind up in parallel realities",0
there is no real risk-reward.- this also goes for staff challenges.,0
" its only tutorial is a store page video (no tooltips, no guiding voice, no handholding) ",0
"I have never encountered so many issues with a game before, ",0
 since there are no public servers.,0
" you can buy Arma 3 AND its DLCs, create a Swat operation using mods available on the workshop that'll be better optimized than the current state of this game.",0
Save yourself the money and go buy something more worth your time such as Battlefield 2042.,0
after 4 hours,0
"Please, please add a photosensitivity option disabling the white flashes, or at a minimum enable the shaders responsible for these flashes to be modded by the phenomenal modding community.",0
 the reviews are far too kind as is.,0
"just as annoying.it has the announcements, the earthquakes, the silly (new) disease names and descriptions. ",0
there is no option to auto send-off patients that you do not have the room to treat. ,0
"i have found that the main complaint, pathfinding, can almost always be attributed to poor design/placement of walls/items. by realizing that people form a line at many places, example - reception, and if that line backs into any other line, example - vending machines, or object, examples - radiators/plants, they bug out. this is especially a problem in wards as where you put screens or plaster casters drastically impact how people move through the room.",0
"now you gotta scroll to see ur stuff. it’s not game breaking you might think, but then some tech you had installed suddenly disappeared or was deleted becuz of the inventory change.",0
 Ethan Gach is a pot stirring brainless poster.,0
" about 1/4 of the games I play I find that my teammates are muted when they speak, though they can still hear me.",0
it is too much waiting in this game. and what you have to do is done quickly and then you have to wait for a long time again before you can do some more in the game.,0
"This game does not respect your time, your actions have no impact, , the game is boring and trivially challenging after only a few hours.",0
And my friend got motion sickness and I wholeheartedly blame the game for this.,0
so it would be helpful to add a difficulty setting.,0
need more keybinding/camera control options for the mouse,0
" done all the modes but it’s a weird feeling, you know this game can be, NO should be so much more and it isn’t, it’s a shallow, vain creature that demands your attention, but rewards you with promises and not the satisfaction achievements or advancement of a narrative.",0
"Exceeded my expectations for a new game,  and not a lot of maps",0
this game needs 2 years of development and another year of beta testing to be good.,0
I was stuck in the loading screen back-to-back from my friend invite and lobby.,0
"Last the only thing I'm not happy with the AI seems so strong I l know a powerful AI maybe bring fun to this game, but I have never seen a AI such powerful, the T without out protection can kill the CT easily. I think it break the balance of the game .",0
It's tiresome to navigate the entire map looking for someone you forgot to report or a small thing you missed.,0
Refunded the game. Even free to play games have a SETTING button.,0
"And when something is being built in the settlement, I have to provide resources, so I have to go here and there and collect the resources, so that one hour later I can do the same thing and one hour later I can do the same thing, and so on. ",0
(no difficulty setting btw).,0
". I often had to sit and pause the game while I sorted through patients, set up new rooms, etc. it is hard to do it while the game is playing because you will get inundated with choices and not really have a way out. I restarted several hospitals, trying to take into account what I learned in the previous round, but it really does not make a difference.",0
raids or some random events that require a lot of players saving a planet or something like that,0
"It just feels too rigid currently. Someone charges you, and you put two rounds of beanbag in their chest at medium range, following it up with a close range kneecap, should NOT kill them. They need to introduce the ""Incapacitated suspect/Civillian"", as at least that was a good middle ground if you didn't just twitch and blow someone’s head off, you could save your final score a bit by just kneecapping the bastards.",0
"So you're often going to feel bored or lonely whilst playing the game. Play this game in a voice call with friends, or watching something in the background to fill the dead air.",0
"keeps on crushing on startup on ubuntu 18.04 ... I am not even able to pass the ""sega"" launch screen",0
"Wish there were some more interesting gadgets to use, maybe some movement tools (scaling elevators or walls would be 10/10 amazing, adding verticality would bring some much-needed map variety), ",0
"Lack of realism is really noticeable, or ",0
 but I had to spend hours finishing up the rest of the game I never got to because of the repetitiveness.  that would allow players to go in and fix already built but broken or run down hospitals.,0
hopefully not at the cost of IRL currency. Maybe some in game currency and a way to earn it would be cool? along with a shop?,0
and lack of optimization tasks,0
"this is a good game with fun content. however, it is far too expensive. the regional pricing that exists on this game is utterly discriminatory. when the game can be had for a 1/6th of the price if you live somewhere else, it is patently unfair. ",0
because my computer is too old.,0
"There's no gravity, except when your boots are actually on the ground. You don't orbit a planet. You don't need to think about your path through a solar system.",0
"while it is far too simplified to be considered a simulator, ",0
 this is pretty unrealistic and entirely unchallenging.,0
this would be more fun if the navigation and placing items were easier.,0
"Edit: multiplayer with 0 cooperation, its basically playing single player while seeing each other.",0
As a left handed I can't play this game the way I do with every other games. . .,0
the game does not give you clear explanation to certain things such as inspection or report.,0
"have only encountered one glitch so far where a patient got ""stuck"" on a building, and no matter how I moved things away from him he would not unstick. after nearly three years in my hospital he is still standing there complaining.",0
" stories with intrigue, character development and suspense.",0
"The gameplay loop reaches its end stage quick,",0
"Some mission prompts give you bad information that will send you on wild goose chases - for example there's a mission that tells you to ask lifeforms ""on your planet"" for information, so you'll run all over your planet looking for answers, until you find an obscure line in the mission log contradicting ALL other instructions and telling you to leave the planet and go to a space station. ",0
"I normally use Nexus, but I really enjoy how streamline mods are when Devs incorporate Workshop support. I cannot recommend Mod IO. I've never dealt with it before, but with the current issues you cannot run your game if you have mods from Mod IO.",0
"after all this years no real multiplay/cooplet me explain, its just an shared area for you and your friends but many parts are not in syncyou can fight enemies, see natural events or other npcs BUT your friends can't see them or interact with them, THEY see their own stuff.",0
"feels completely pointless. Sure, there is something of a story but all it seems your doing is flying from one place to another endlessly.",0
"The menus drift around, the galaxy map is just awful to interact with,, the in-game guide has key words highlighted in arbitrary colours that don't provide any additional information, the different economies are represented by names/symbols/colours that are not ever shown  together, etc etc etc.",0
I have followed step by step guides and YouTube video is click by click... failed. ,0
the game started feeling like a grind.,0
"The tutorial is so overly complicated, lengthy, and glitchy, that I am on my 3rd run of the game, because the last 2 tutorials soft blocked me. ",0
The option just pops up whenever it wants.,0
 I have a specific place to keep my game screenless and it's weird when it's not all together.,0
 it will run from buttery smooth to hard freezing and stuttering and always in the worst moments.,0
"Enjoyed the gameplay, unfortunately the brightness settings and then flashlights conflicted too much. Would go from impossible to see anything because it's too dark to impossible to see anything because it's too bright.  ",0
only dislike is I suck on keyboard. I play on xbox remote.,0
are super hard to kill even with light armor not like you with your super heavy armor dying to a knife stab.,0
"But sadly I just felt like refunding it,",0
the game play loop in my honest opinion is not enjoyable. Now I will say I did not play this game extensively only about an hour and a half but in that hour and half I felt pretty solid in my decision to refund it before the two hour time limit.,0
 I do love that the game will get more content in the future I wish there was official controller support for the game here is an update for 2022the game has received  massive updates over the course of 2022 there are now more weapons gadgets attachments. ,0
I might like this game if you did not need to play through the campaign to unlock sandbox mode which is just a pain,0
I dislike how when I click find session to play with strangers it kicks me back to main menu and tells me I lost connection to the server host.,0
some could argue it is not high on difficulty though virtual reality paradise players might be exaggerating about all the negatives. difficulty is not high ,0
and on top you are using gender language? you gotta be kidding! Won´t get a single cent from me!,0
high learning curve gameplay.,0
"I would really appreciate filters in video settings. I use Geforce experience to turn it B&W, add some grain and letterbox.. . I think if they added that touch along with other filters it would be an amazing experience. I would ideally like a B&W experience with red blood.",0
"It would be nice if there was a little more depth in the procedural content, but I have not even left the star system I started in yet, so who knows what is out there.",0
"I will say that on lower end PCs,",0
turn off PVP in settings because there will be groups of people picking on you if you don't.,0
I give it an F for no filter or for the word you here more than any other word,0
You can't do the campaign with other players/friends ,0
"once you start a school year you essentially just sit around and twiddle your thumbs, unless some kind of emergency occurs.",0
Turkish language support please ):,0
"Planets could have more diverse features, such as rivers, maybe planets overridden by AI, planets with tons of life and no colonies/trade posts etc. Smaller planets should have less gravity.",0
Enemies would spawn in and I couldn’t see them or they couldn’t see my enemies. There would be invisible worms and invisible flying enemies. My world would have a storm and I would have to run back to find cover but my friends next to me would have nothing. Then I would come back to join them after my storm was gone and they would be getting a storm. ,0
" the incentives to explore are basically inexistent, ship crafting is non-existent also.",0
every time I do a photo missionit crash but only for those photo missions.,0
So I bought the supporter edition.,0
my rig is old now and was only mid ranged when I built it 6 years ago. ,0
So lazy to not incorporate full controller support so it can be played on steam deck. ,0
It's been out for almost five years and it's still buggier than an early access game.,0
", but you always die and lose everything you have. ",0
* freezing and hitching every time a player enters or exits the current planetary system,0
there is no good reason for me to be getting a steady 11-20 fps on this game with that equipment.,0
My biggest criticism so far is a lack of simplifying options in the inventory menu's interface (making you have to drag and drop to stacks of similar things in other inventories).,0
On most maps I have to have my resolution and all graphics settings all the way down and the game still stutters and lags.,0
"as of right now, the game feels unrefined and far too automated.",0
 the game released in a terrible state.,0
"There are myriad ways the game could be improved like: - Make the procedural landscapes feel less procedural. Maybe there is a way to use actual aerial imagery from Earth, Mars, and the Moon in a machine learning environment to truly create a believable randomized natural landscape.",0
"I know this might sound dumb to 99% of the player base here, but I am mute and playing with anyone in coop is a nightmare for me for the most part, having to make my own Auto Hotkey script for commands and simple replies just to not stop and type for a second as I need that time. SWAT 4 had a system where you could easily talk to your team as lead and as a team member with the command menu, I really hope they add that into Ready Or Not or else this review will change to a No.",0

first personal computer game I have bothered to play in years,1
"Because the game was primarily developed and optimized for PlayStation 4 (which has 8 cores), it needs 8 threads or 8 cores to function properly. ",1
 so I upgraded my weapons and not so much a pacifist anymore.,1
Once you setup a farm you can get pretty much infinite money (units) and you can convert units into nanites by buying spaceships at space stations and trashing them. ,1

you get more challenges and more challenges from staff as you move from hospital to hospital. ,1
"I was kinda intrigued when I found out that unlike hospital tycoon, this game is backed by the creators of the original theme hospital. They even listened to their fans- due to the outcry, two point studios has convinced sega to ditch denuvo and ",1
Tries to get you to feel alone but there's people to talk to everywhere you look.,1
(I'm saying this as a 57 year old so you young ones will catch on even faster).,1
you no longer need that early training room and paid students when you can just blow some money (which you swim in) on marketing to attract qualified staff. ,1
"It's not GTFO style hard, ",1
"I've never reviewed a game,",1
"Steam Worshop support is out the window, which I guess you can count as a positive if you're looking to play on console in a few years when they port it?",1
"but beware, if you make them wear gas masks or ballistic face shields, their voice will be muffled, so it's harder to hear their feedback.",1
"simple customization scheme, and yet lots of variation",1
"but if you want a complete and polished experience, wait for the full release unless you want to see the game evolve over time!",1
it is like the building mode of sims 4 but replace a school also,1
"This game has 1 achievement ""First arrest"" and all you have to do is detain one person. 56% of players have this achievement... The other 44% of players take no prisoners",1
so this really encourages proper teamwork and execution to ensure proper sight lines are achieved on hostiles that may be lurking behind doors and around tight corridors.,1

"and I'm very glad I did. I decided to abandon my mouse/keyboard controls to try using a controller, and it made a night and day difference for me. ",1
"I'm not stating something new here, I know others have posted this complaint.- Killing animals on planets as a bounty.",1
i participated in NMS Twitch drops and on twitch inventory I have skins that I got through it ,1
especially for a rig that is becoming outdated.,1
prefer the hard science and harder physics of something,1
 if you look at my profile screens shots I was global elite in Counter strike and is currently immortal in Valorant.,1
"Explore where you want and rename your discoveries, I discovered a system where ",1
i only play VR mode,1
Originally played on ps4 but have since moved to PC and Ps5 Versions. ,1
a really fun game but you do have to be good at clearing rooms and to have a quick reaction either there is a civilian or a criminal going to kill you the second he gets to,1
My pc meets the recommended requirements exactly with amd cpu and gpu. ,1
"As of 1.3, No Man is Sky received what I consider its first official release, after the clunky alpha and beta stages.",1
Once I figured out how to go into first person view (no more clanky 3rd person animations).,1
I am running an 11th gen i9 and a 3080 ti with 64 gb ddr4. ,1
the sound effects puts you in the right place every single time.,2
with modifiers and recent balance changes have made the game more diverse and while still little easy much more agency is allotted to the player to improve reliability while also still being relatively unpredictable,2
I've been a supporter for this game ever since,2
" as you unlock more items, diseases, and rooms you can go back and build up your previous hospitals, raising them to three star levels in your pursuit of perfection.",2
"RP with learning languages and skills, quest, build bases work together or",2
"realistic scenarios and different scenarios such as hostage rescue, bomb threat, active shooter, barricade enemies and raids.",2
the options to play online challenges with friends who also have the game is fun for those who need some more social interaction in the game.,2
"What I actually do want to talk about is the fact that, whatever the state of the game might have been or might become, I really enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the almost surreal atmosphere (literally and figuratively) of a world so seemingly alive and full of things to do that you could study every single life form and landmass across the surface of the immense planets if you so choose. I'm not one for mindless exploration but there's so much to find and so much that caught my eye that I was baffled. Crashed ships, maps, secrets, mysteries and societies to bargain with and even run for yourself.",2
the game does a very good job of making each level interesting from the previous level,2
I started playing again last week and am having a lot of fun with it.,2
I like everything... ,2
some very easy beginner levels with more difficult ones thrown in once you progress further.,2
"i am big on puzzles, and this game definitely fits those categories.",2
""" it is amazing! No Man's Sky also makes me feel alone” which is a good thing. We may be social creatures, but we need time alone: time to think, time to reflect, and time to process our past, present, and future.",2
"i put dozens of hours into this game on Xbox game pass for pc, ",2
yet it pays you back with the amount of awesome content you can unlock ,2
" I have only left my starting solar system twice, maybe 3 times.. . and I still feel like I haven't explored a hundredth of even that.",2
A lot of new content is pushed out in every update ,2
using night vision is cool.,2
without losing your progress.,2
"the building your own stuff was not new to me, but the way two point campus is set up brings a new life to the whole 'build your own', its a whole lot of fun!",2
"The game has a steep learning curve, it's a challenging swat sim that should satisfy hardcore gamers.",2
"There is always something to do, someone to find, neat little things hidden all over and you never know what you will dig into when you go mining.",2
"the game looks great, runs great and plays great.",2
this builds constant sense of anticipation as the player awaits their highest payout of the round and goes long way to make each individual spin maintain sense of excitement even after you have had 20 30 runs of it along with,2
very easy to get the hang of even if you have not played theme hospital before.,2
An incredibly good feeling co-op tactical shooter experience ,2
"I received this game from a friend of mine, it is fully worth the money as I would gladly return it and spend my own money on it in a heartbeat.",2
you are presented with enough monthly and quarterly data that ,2
"great game: cool humor, satisfying gameplay mechanics, reasonable and ""configurable"" pacing - you can move on if you want, you can stay longer to pick up basics and mechanics, so you won not be overwhelmed.",2
"Great gun play,  can play causal/dumb or be super milsimy.",2
 You can get such crazy things like jetpack that emits rainbows or some badass bounty hunter helmet for your character.,2
" and the community is very nice and when you visit the Nexus, people often give you expensive stuff just because why not.",2
 I've ever done I would recommend worth the price,2
"some of the puzzles are a bit complicated, but everything manageable if you just try.",2
but this game stands out very differently from something compared to Rainbow 6 ,2
"He promised the game had changed, that it wasn't the hot mess it had been at launch. I... have to admit that it looked good.",2
it dose lack a little with content and a few bugs but I do think it will get better with some updated versions a content update and/or a dlc ,2
"it is a fun to game to play while listening to podcasts, but the funny voice lies make it worth playing unmuted. Fun and relaxing",2
the story length of the game extends further than one may think. ,2
it provides a very chill and easy experience so you can get that space exploration without a powerful computer or hours of game play practice.,2
 the movement is God tier,2
"Thank you Hello Games Supporting this game that’s been lost to the bigger publishers, and I’m so glad that this still happens here.",2
"All-in-all, a great game for fans of the SWAT series, ",2
I was having a lot of fun with the game making video is for my YouTube channel.,2
There are some weird places and some amazingly beautiful places. You'll find yourself standing overlooking a valley that leads to an ocean with a ringed planet in the sky and the sun(s) setting at the horizon. There's a trade port over there where all sorts of ships are flying in to and out from. There's some weird building guarded by robots that may just have something interesting.,2
"This game is no longer the dud everyone said it was at launch, it has not become one of the best open world games out today.",2
What's better is it isn’t your typical shoot everything that moves game. ,2
"you could play as a galactic photographer, taking pictures across the universe. I enjoy this sort of play.",2
"fun, cartoony graphics ",2
I enjoy this game a lot and it is great to play while listening to podcasts.,2
I absolutely cannot wait for the Steam Workshop and proper modding to come so maps and cool overhaul mods are more accessible and one click away rather than manually placing them on the pack folder.,2
"I play in VR, and with time,  Luckily, the uncomfortableness of the glasses makes it easier to disconnect, take a breather, and then enjoy again another day.",2
I am a huge Tarkov fan,2
 something you would never see from other developers in this day and age.,2
"I enjoyed it immensely and put in a lot of time, making it I believe my highest play time game on Steam as of writing this. ",2
"SWAT 4 for me was easily the pinnacle in tactical FPS games and RON has taken that spot now,  building off of the concept that existed and refining it for a modern gaming generation.",2
I've invested dozens of hours into the game and still have hundreds of hours of gameplay ahead of me. ,2
Maybe it's just because I aspire to be an astronomer and I love space but I would consider NMS to be my new favourite game.,2
it up will potentially have one of the best tactical FPS we have ever seen.,2
I preordered this game because I was so excited for it after playing two point hospital.,2
"is it as good at tph? No. When two point campus was announced I was cautiously optimist,  and for the most part, I was pleasantly surprised. the game uses the same style as two point hospital but the mechanics behind the scenes are very different.",2
I played the crap outta every bullfrog game; theme hospital was the one I preferred.,2
"runs like a dream on my modest gaming laptop,",2
 I am flat out amazed at how much content there is in this game as of May 2022!,2
"The developers brought the game back to life with massive, reputation-changing FREE updates,",2
but I think the devs could learn a bit from Escape From Tarkov,2
"I'm sure it will be better after some time in development, but",2
I am glad that it’s been released for Early Access / BETA. I’m excited to see what other bits are coming after the game is fully released.,2
the satisfaction of winning as a hider or successfully eliminating all the hiders as the seeker is unmatched.,2
and good for screenshot lol,2
realistic and satisfying as hell.,2
"This game makes me feel like both a super survivalist living on a sharp thin edge, or the dumbest most bumbling moron space tourist in the galaxy, only staying alive because the technology is so good. Driving = is a blast, do you have any idea how nice it is to have a starter vehicle that doesn’t flip over\ drift all over the place like everything is ice, or get stopped by tiny bits of terrain or ™¥™¥™¥™¥™¥™¥™¥ ",2
I am a huge fan of building and management games. ,2
I really enjoyed the 5+ actual hours,2
"also there is a fun Facebook group to join as well that is fan ran and creates fun challenges and an open, friendly environment to discuss strategies, stories and get help with anything!",2
" and great graphics,",2
"You are guided on this journey not only by helpful tutorial messages, ",2
"good management choices, , ",2
but at bare minimum I have high respect for the developers for retaining their credibility through actions and not photo shopping a PR statement when making a huge mistake which seems to be the norm nowadays.,2
 as I love this studio and there is a lot of lovely stuff in the game,2
if you enjoyed theme hospital from the late 90 is then this is definitely a game for you.,2
"once you learn how to play it, it is very easy to dominate. I never feared for having money, even at the start of a map, or with really any decision I made. unfortunately, this is also its downfall. ",2
This is probably the best exploration slash survival game out their in general and almost certainly bar none in the sci-fi genre.,2
really fun especially when you communicate with teammates. ,2
This game is pretty good ,2
This is the most underrated title out there imo.,2
" like Battlefield 2042, COD Vanguard, etc.",2
"Very good graphics, ",2
amazing new vibe love it epic and hard and rewarding,2
"incredibly addictive game-play,",2
"His world will take place in a vast world, stripped of its limitations, since all that will appear will be accessible to the smallest of nebulae in the remotest star, not to mention the countless planets or flake the Galaxy. ",2
i have got all the stars and all teh achievements and enjoyed the game.,2
"I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, one handed while I recovered.",2
"From things like proper use of flashlight (if you light the window from the wrong angle it will blind you), through completely unpredictable behavior of enemies like  faking being dead, faking surrender just to shoot at you when you get close, hiding or taking cover in places",2
This game is way to good to pass up especially if you have v desktop and a VR headset takes a while to figure out but is good and ,2
the graphics are wonderful;,2
"added it to my Wishlist, then I finally bought it a couple days ago.",2
"There are half a dozen levels or so to play with different scenarios available to select on each which vary in difficulty (bomb threat, active shooter, hostage rescue to name but a few) ",2
" it is ... a more scaled-back, mindless experience,",2
Who would have thought a 58-year-old grandmother would become a No Man's Sky avid player!,2
"had my reservations, but it is actually pretty good! All of the goodness of the original, with extra added details.",2
"funny radio station, funky music and",2
 and graphics can be adjusted to allow you to enjoy the best experience.,2
I love love love the game due to being an old hospital tycoon player back in the day,2
"""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. "" The 3-rd law by Arthur C. Clarke. I started a review with Clarke's quotation, because the world of ""No Man's Sky"" is really magical despite its obvious sci-fi basis. ",2
it feels like the developers heard all the wishes from players in hospital and made them for campus!,2
thought this game would annoy me but I find it enjoyable escape from reality of real hospital work.,2
easy to control via steam controller.,2
I have hundreds of hours logged in this game,2
Crazy realistic swat vibes that really has never been done before; the game has a lot of detail along with the fact that it feels like you are a swat member absolutely NUTS,2
"I only have one friend that plays the game, but every day we chat about new discoveries that we've made and adventures we've had. This game has honestly made me feel like a kid again.",2
There is a steep learning curve to become familiar with the games technology but that is part of the fun.,2
 for those looking for a realistic tactical response simulation.,2
"The rewarding team play, and complexity of the task involved is an immense sense of satisfaction to navigate.",2
" they combined the regular inventory & cargo slots into one list, and you can now only equip tech upgrades in Technology slots, meaning that any upgrades equipped to a normal inventory slot became unequipped, but was left in your inventory as a regular item that you can just re-equip at any time as long as you have an available tech slot for it. ",2
I'm partial to things such asthis game delivers all that pretty darn well.,2
"I hope the devs look at making an attack and defend type game mode comparable to Rainbow Six Siege, ",2
"Maps are varied in size and design, different scenarios is really cool and keeps the game feeling fresh.",2
rewards curiosity and imagination.,2
"there is a lot of community for it, on reddit, YouTube, discord, and the game is own forums, where you can find strategy guides, tips and people to work with on online projects to unlock additional items.",2
this is worth each and every money I spent.,2
I guess sales will rocket when PvP mode is added.,2
As much as I’ve replayed the maps so it doesn't get very repetitive.,2
"The interface/interaction controls may take some getting used to, but in my opinion, are laid out sensibly.",2
 if the game updates and proves itself.,2
the guns have punch,2
"Time is flying, the earth is rotating, and the no man's sky is still updating.",2
the developer is twisted sense of humor adds to the games enjoyment.,2
while some of the puzzles are solved by random clicking ,2
 Ready or Not provides an opportunity to practice precise discernment and defusing of a situation with as little room for error or injury as possible.,2
 sandbox-style sims games.,2
"I'm 34, I'm old and demanding and I really can't afford to start playing at 5 pm only to end at 2:30 am, wondering, how the hell I'm going to wake up for work (which I did yesterday, thanks to NMS).",2
 and a cryptic story to slowly explore;,2
"A first person shooter that is legitimately terrifying and stressful, ",2
"you can tell that this is not an English game as they offer private tutoring as ""private tuition"" and as a current college student, it makes me laugh a bit to get notifications stating my students completed their ""tuition session"". all in all, fun game.",2
Highly recommended and ,2
have AMD with above recommended hardware.,2
for me it runs smooth as silk at 4k with highest settings. ,2
"it is like theme hospital, clearly in art style and comedy style. ",2
"bored, nothing to do",0
