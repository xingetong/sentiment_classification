"A movie that does many things right, but is not worth watching.

This movie is good. It is not great, but it covers a lot of bases. The directing is excellent, with camera work and scene structure that builds to a worthy end. The acting is great, with Renee Russo and Jake Gyllenhaal remaining captivating throughout. Gyllenhaal's character deeply flawed protagonist is excellent as it delicately balances multiple deep character flaws that leave you uncertain and curious to know what happens next. But the story is... unsatisfying. Anticlimactic. Poor. And far worse. Without spoilers I will do the best I can. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays a character who has no character arc, that is not the point of this movie. He starts off desperate and hungry for success, and he ends the same way. We only see the slightest suggestions of him becoming more successful, and we see how far he will go for that success - but this is not new, as we see him go just as far in the opening minutes of the film. Though I imagine everyone is expecting the movie and plot to go in a certain direction (because it is an absurdly cliche story that you have seen before in TV shows, other movies, and books), the movie ends up aiming slightly lower to avoid being entirely cliche. I am certain that at some point the writer/director realized that this was just another retelling of an old trope, and tried to edit the ending to make it a tad less obvious. It does not benefit the movie. Taking a trope and making it weaker does not make a strong movie, it makes a forgettable movie. That is what this movie is - incredibly forgettable. But that is not all that is wrong with the writing in this film. Gyllenhaal's character is clearly autistic (and the writer/director has confirmed this is intentional) to the point that this comes off as a hit piece about people with autism. I have worked with people on the spectrum and while Gyllenhaal's portrayal of an autistic protagonist is well done, the writing behind it disastrously misunderstands what autism is. While the writing has Gyllenhaal correctly neglecting enormous social cues, it also portrays him as obscenely manipulative, exercising such enormous control over social situations that it is absurd. To be frank, regardless of how high functioning Jake Gyllenhaal's character is supposed to be, he cannot both be autistic and simultaneously be so ridiculously successfully manipulative in social situations. This movie makes autistic people out to be self centered villains who will stop at absolutely nothing to obtain what they want. It is a disgustingly misinformed examination of autism. At this point you may be wondering why this movie has such high reviews. While it may be due to Jake Gyllenhaal's convincing glass eyed smiles or Renee Russo's believable portrayal of a struggling exec, I think it also has to do with a less impressive aspect of the film. This movie aims for low hanging fruit, criticizing the news media for being exploitative and corrupt. Literally all of America (and much of the world) has an issue with this right now, the only difference from person to person being exactly which stations they think are worse. I am not saying the media does not deserve this criticism (it really does), and the movie does an excellent job at portraying how ratings come before morality - I am just saying that this is the modern equivalent of making an 80's scifi movie where the military and government are the villains. But that is it. A huge cliche aimed at an easy target. A disgustingly inaccurate portrayal of a person with autism. A well directed movie with a very low goal that completely succeeds at what it is trying to do, but will be forgotten by the next day.",1

I just couldn't feel the characters at all and it felt like a filler book? Do you know what I mean? I'm seeing this more and more with these authors that pump out books every 3 months. Sure it makes them money, but their books are a hit or miss with me. It seems as if this was in the miss checklist. It felt like the story was slow but the concept rushed.

I'd like to say ""wow, love these"" but I can't. It wouldn't take much to turn these into great bibs and I would have paid a bit more to get it. These are better than most $40 bibs, yes, and they are a lot worse than $180 bibs. I'd have rather paid a little more to get a couple minor improvements and then the difference between these and $180 bibs would have been far less and this would be a 5 star review. So where's the area for improvements: 1) In this price range a gel chamois is expected or at least something approximating that sort of density. Sadly I didn't see that in the description it says ""foam"" padding. That's just lame. It really doesn't do much of anything padding wise. 2) While I'm sure it helps from a coolness factor, the bib straps are just too flimsy a material. It isn't the same as the rest of the shorts so it really doesn't pull the shorts up and keep them in position. Better than a drawstring at the waist but just not as functional as a bib should be. If you want bibs that would be great for relatively short rides (padding not so important) in hot weather, these would be ok, but they really aren't up there for more substantial rides.",1

This product did not do as well as I had hoped. I have used the spectracide weed killer but not this. The weed killer worked very well. I purchased this because I have crabgrass. It took several applications and still did not knock it all the way down. Disappointing",1
"VERY Small Brush

The brush itself is okay, but very small in comparison to what I thought it would be. I will only be able to use it to blend my highlight or concealer, not to blend my foundation. Very disappointing.",1

"About as good a South Park experience as I think could ever ...

About as good a South Park experience as I think could ever be made; it looks great, is funny, and moves along at a fine pace. If you're a fan of South Park, it's a no-brainer; however, it's not a perfect video game. The difficulty is laughably easy, and overall the RPG elements are good but not great. But, they fit the setting and theme well. Given that the game is not very lengthy, it made for an above average experience overall despite a few flaws. Recommended for fans of the show.",1

Ok, so if you are a tall, svelte, supermodel type this will be fabulous on you. Otherwise you will need to pay to have many inches of fabric taken up from the bottom because it is designed for someone who is maybe 5'10' wearing high heels. I am 5'4"" and prefer lower heels. I was so disappointed because the top fit wonderfully and is so gorgeous.

You mean 18 pack, right. I was sent only 18 in my 20 pack. Why? In the past I have bought a 20 pk and a 40 pk. This makes me wonder if any of the others were short. Low rating because of this. Obviously, other than that, I have no complaints because I have bought so many.",1

It's really great and fun to mess around with, though I have two issues with it. Firstly, the colors for the magic used do not correspond to what it is meant to be. For example gravity is supposed to be purple but on mine it is showing up as red like fire would. Blizzard is meant to be blue but on mine it shows green like cure. My second issue is whenever I try to use the keyhole projection, it's not actually projecting it out. It makes the noises and everything and if I look into the actual part where the light is supposed to come from, I can see it but it won't project out for whatever reason.

I love that the lights are bright, flash and change colors. They demand attention. I hope people see me and avoid hitting me rather than wonder ""what is that?"" and run me over to get a closer look. So, I wrapped them around the pole. It looks awesome. But the next day, the clear, squishy plastic came off in places. Don't try this at home. Even if I did no harm, it doesn't look good. I bought two, one had a rip in the plastic. The replacement will go on the other pole without getting bent, twisted,rolled or mutilated.",2

This is a great backpack. The only draw back is the hook & loop panels inside aren't as large as I'd like them to be. Good design and very comfortable. No waste/hip belt, but if you're carrying enough weight that you need one than you should just use a larger pack. Plenty of room for my gear. Stitching is lighter than I'd like, but this was designed to look like a civilian/school pack.",2

Perfect for my mini bed side work station since i’m working on my laptop most of the time and sometimes i’m receiving video calls from my family while i work at night i can just use the selfie ring light with stand and phone holder clipped on desk without turning the lights on and disturb my husband while sleeping. Also, you can check the video i attached on how to use it. Very easy to operate. It has power button and other buttons for switching the light tones and brightness. Making this review because my money is not wasted 💕 worth the price and quality itself ❤️",2

This glue gun is a beast! It will go through some glue sticks fast, but it will glue just about anything!

"Great for chronic hip pain

Had a huge impact on my hip and lower back pain as well as improved sleeping. It is a little uncomfortable at first but so it standing correctly. Mostly it is the straps cutting in under your arms. It also tends to ride up your belly and has to be pulled back down a few times a day. Sti, the pain relief was better than yoga, chiropractic adjustments and diet changes. I am really surprised how much it helped. Good luck",2

"Omarosa's Autobiography

This was a readable book, and enjoyable enough, but not exactly a tell-all. Divided into sections, the first tells of her years of interaction with Trump on the Apprentice. The second section is a quick glossing over of the campaign, not really revealing anything new, but explaining how and why she came to work on the campaign. Finally, she relates another glossing-over of her White House days; again not revealing many previously unreported details. She does have a rather unique perspective as she has known Trump for quite awhile and has been able to observe the mental deterioration during those years.",2
"If you liked Fir Coat...Well, this is almost the same.

I love this brand. The similarity to Fir Coat is a little bit disappointing, and both of those are very close to Salem (although Salem lacks the holographic glitter and has a black base rather than a deep blue, the colors are very close by merit of being dark blue/greens). I've TRIED to provide photos of all three for comparison, but for some reason I'm unable. I like them all and don't regret the purchase at all, it's quite cute and even if it's very close to Fir Coat...well, it's very close to one of my favorites so that isn't exactly a bad thing. As for the brand and the polish quality itself, I love this brand and find it has a lot of staying power even with the considerable abuse that I put it through. It removes well when I want it to, but holds up very well.",2

These grips are a lifesaver for magic mice. They make it so much more comfortable to hold and move around if you're like me and have your pinky hanging off the right hand edge.

Being from Louisiana myself and having married into a Cajun family I really enjoy these stories. This particular one had laughs in the right places, but the development of Miss Prim and Proper was too simple.

"Snug fit. Nice under clothing-cannot tell

"Confusing settings but good drying brush

It's great to have a brush that also blow dries my hair! It was a little confusing what the 3 settings actually do. Thankfully, the seller sent an email to explain: LOW--Cool Heat & High Air Speed MIDDLE--Warm Temp & Low Air Speed HIGH--Hot Temp & High Air Speed **Please note that the sign of settings indicates the heat and temperature, not the air speed. In other word, there are 3 level of heat and 2 blower speed. It is different from other hair dryer and it is easy for you to have a confused idea that settings are broke. If you encounter this confusion, please be eased. This helped to clear up the confusion. Good product!",2

Nothing to say here, they're metal plates with adhesive on the back.",2

The set is cute. My daughter 6 yr old wore it for school and looked so cute. It’s a good deal for all 4 pieces at that price but the quality of the skirt of is very cheap.

"This bluetooth is very handy and easy to carry around

This bluetooth is very handy and easy to carry around. What I like about this device is that Selfie don't need to raise your hand far just to get a good picture and struggle pressing that button for the camera. Another thing about this device is that it comes with an extra holder to the bluetooth clicker and you either put it on the stick or your finger, but it is better to put it on the stick for a long range selfie. Another thing i notice about this Universal Wireless bluetooth Camera is that the plus (+) and the minus (-) sign can also work to take a picture. I think it is serve to zoom in zoom out but for my S8 it works as to take a snap shot picture. Design it look sleek and doesn't look cheap to look at. When it comes to emergency photo with a group good to have it around.",2
"Great headphones

I was skeptical at first but these headphones are pretty good for the price. When I put these headphones in they block out all of the outside noise. Sound quality in my opinion is great. The only complaint I have is the part of the headphones that wrap around your ears are pretty flimsy. But other than that these are really good, and I would definitely recommend these before you decide to spend over a $100 for some beats",2

"Good, and easy enough to use for the price!

I ordered this to repaint some cabinet doors. They had your typical tongue-and-groove design, making it impossible to paint an even coat without it looking all globby. While I found out the paint I was using was also infuriating other customers (Valspar High Gloss Enamel SUCKS, is NOT ""self-leveling"" or ""easy to clean,"" and chips with the scrape of a thumbnail despite surface prep!) Overall, you have to clean this device quickly in between uses, but for this price point you can seriously knock some extra work and time off of a project that may take days to do the old-fashioned way. It was worth it to me! I will definitely be using it long into the future. Checkout a breakdown of various components below: Anyway, this product was fairly easy to use after perusing the instructions for a bit. While the viscosity cup provided is supposed to help indicate how much to thin your paint, it didn't really work for its intended purpose, as my paint was taking FOREVER to go through the funnel, way beyond any of the indicated times on the instructions. (For example, instructions indicate to add certain amount of water or thinner based on amount of time it takes for the paint to run through the funnel filled to the top). This led to some difficulty in figuring out how much I should dilute my paint, which led to some trial and error. However, most paint cans do have instructions for paint sprayer dilution, so that helped some! >APPLICATION - relatively easy but takes a bit of practice and increasing the velocity of the spray to ensure it is coming out in an even stream and not in splatters, which can also be affected a lot by how much you diluted it. Won't flow correctly if it is too thick. Difficult to do small applications of paint because you have to keep scraping the paint to the bottom of the container for it to be sucked through the straw. >DEVICE ITSELF - turns on easily, but I will say it the motor starts getting pretty hot quickly, which made me a bit nervous to use it for more than a few minutes at a time. Parts are all easy to assemble/reassemble. >CLEANING - While the parts are easy to clean, I frequently wished that I could put it down and come back to it later in between coats. Paint can be left in the reservoir if you seal it well with plastic wrap, but you have to run water through the sprayer otherwise it will get all dried up VERY fast with water-based paint once you turn it off. You 100% NEED a straw-cleaning bristle brush to clean the sprayer channels that don't detach from the device if anything dries up, otherwise globby and half-dried paint starts going through the nozzle and screwing up the spray pattern.",2

This is so easy to install and looks great! It does tend to lean forward because the camera makes it top heavy.",2
"Good purchase

I had been looking for a regular blender for a long time (nothing fancy just something to make milkshakes and smoothies for the family) when I came across this one. It's definitely a great value. The pitcher isn't made of cheap plastic like some other blenders. It's very easy to clean and to use.",2
"Many uses for this foam tape

I originally bought this to close gaps around the top of my exterior doors. Since then, I've also discovered it works well for closing up gaps at the bottom (threshold) of my door, and around the sides as well. It sticks well and is very easy to use.",2
"Five Stars

This is a nice case, inexpensive and fits perfectly.",2
"Tiny but versatile

Its smaller than what I expected but gives a decent amount of perfectly cooked rice (perfect for 1 or 2 persons). Its easy to clean and takes up very little space. Good product for low price. Highly recommended!",2
"Anecdotal evidence is almost my life in a nutshell.

Like that is was simple and straightforward and the strategies can be implemented right away with ease.",2
"Its working fine

I'm restringing a necklace that had cord & leather. The leather gave out. So far so good.",2
"So happy!

I’m so happy I finally bought this stroller!!! It’s so much smoother and lighter than my BOB single stroller. It’s perfect, I highly recommend it for running. It folds up easy and takes up less room than my BOB as well. If you are looking for a stroller to go shopping ( in and out of doors ) this is not for you as it’s too big to fit through normal doorways you the tiniest bit. If you, like me just wanted a stroller to pop in the trunk to go for a run this is the one for you.",2
"Nice product.

Nice product. I purchased this privacy screen for my office and it has helped tremendously with prying eyes. I had to make sure the measurements were accurate and when this came, fit perfectly! This screen is not too dark that I didn't have to adjust my light level to see. I liked this feature as well. Once I started using this, everyone stopped looking at my screen when they talk to me. Now I don't have to close everything or lock my screen when I get visitors in my office. Wonderful!!",2
"Another enjoyable read

Looking forward to the next volume in this series.",2
