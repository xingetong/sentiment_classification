I would have loved to return the item but the time frame for a return understandably expired in February. Him and his dad clean a lot of fish, so admittedly they are probably really good at doing it manually. If you are very bad at it, this device could be an improvement for you.",0

Haven't decided yet whether I will be returning these or if I want to take the time to make some alterations to the seat cover so I can get it over the head rest. Seller should mention that the head rest needs to be removed to be able to install properly.

Every time I got it working correctly and vacuuming decent, it would just fall apart in the middle of the pool and dump everything back out! Come on Intex, you can do better!

Pros: - Strudy, solid handle, organizer compartment up top is nice, dust or water can't enter easily. - Design-wise, it looks nice and clean. I like that it's clear. Cons: - Mine came missing the buckle on the front. - The fatal design flaw is that that ""tracks"" on either side (where the hanging folder arms rest in) don't extend the entirety of the box sides. They just end mid-way. Thus, there is a full 1.25"" inch or so, in both the front of the back, where there is no track. Thus, you lose 2.5"" of folder space in the box. That ALSO means that every time I sort through folders and move them forward or backward, they easily pop out of the track. And that annoys the heck outta me. I would return it if it wasn't too late.

I've seen better quality in the simplest children's/beginner tools sets. I may take sandpaper to them some day, but right now they will live in the back of a drawer somewhere in my studio.",0

I'm also afraid to put my cell phone in it because of how rough the matieral is, and the sharp edges of zippers. So I've learned my lesson with online purse shopping.

"Great Material On The Product, But Plagued With Eye And Mouth Issues

I was really looking forward to having a ski mask for cold days. However, this is not what I was looking for. The material between the eyes is so thin that I feel like it's held together by 1 or 2 strands. I'm guessing I would have ripped it immediately had I not been careful putting it on. The mouth is terribly small as well and doesn't feel like it's in the proper position. The only good thing about this mask is the material - It's pretty hefty and seems like it would keep me warm, but I can't outlook the issue with the eyes and mouth. It would be so simple to slightly widen the strip between the eyes, and maybe use less fabric on the sides of the mouth. So far I have yet to find a decent black ski mask on Amazon - pass this one up if you're looking for quality.",0

After using it for several weeks the pillow is quite flat and does not provide the comfort level hoped for.

I’ll let you know how it is. ORIGINAL: These are great but tend to bunch up.

"Disappointing

I have several issues with this endoscope that caused me to return it: 1) There are two laws of civil engineering: F=MA and ""You can't push on a rope."" This device violates rule #2. It isn't nearly rigid enough. I wanted to look above my ceiling to trace the electrical wiring, but I couldn't snake this thing more than about four feet before it started to bend and bunch up. Trying to negotiate it through any sort of rough terrain is maddening when you can't see well and you have no control over the tip. All you can do is push on that rope. Why have a 10 meter scope if you can't use more than four feet of it? You might be able to run it down some kind of conduit or pipe or reinforce the cable with wire to stiffen it, but I don't feel like that should be necessary. 2) Thinking maybe I was using this for the wrong purpose, I tried running it down a drain pipe. I couldn't negotiate the P trap and the camera got covered with gunk so quickly that it wouldn't have mattered if I could. I think the best use for this is to look under your refrigerator or maybe in your gutter downspout. 3) The camera needs some kind of self-leveling mechanism. It's impossible to keep the cable from rotating as you try to maneuver it. You can tell the app to rotate the image 90 degrees at a time, but you can't tell the scope to stay right side up. You're constantly trying to figure out which way is up and what you're looking at. 4) When you add attachments, they block the view of the camera. It's like walking around using only your peripheral vision. It works, but not well. With much effort I successfully retrieved my keys using the magnet and the hook when they were on the floor right in front of me, so there's some theoretical value there. The mirror attachment is simply unusable -- I already said it was hard to use, once you can't see what's in front of you it's impossible. 5) The ""magic claw"" isn't attached to the device at all. It's a completely separate tool, and not very good. Search Amazon for ""flexible grabber"" and you'll see what it is, except it's only 2 feet long including the handle. Worthless. 6) You have to disconnect from your normal WiFi network in order to connect to this device. Not a deal killer, but inconvenient. There are a few things I liked about this device: 1) It's fairly inexpensive 2) The camera is decent 3) The light is good unless it gets covered in gunk 4) I found it fairly easy to connect",0

"A movie that does many things right, but is not worth watching.

This movie is good. It is not great, but it covers a lot of bases. The directing is excellent, with camera work and scene structure that builds to a worthy end. The acting is great, with Renee Russo and Jake Gyllenhaal remaining captivating throughout. Gyllenhaal's character deeply flawed protagonist is excellent as it delicately balances multiple deep character flaws that leave you uncertain and curious to know what happens next. But the story is... unsatisfying. Anticlimactic. Poor. And far worse. Without spoilers I will do the best I can. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays a character who has no character arc, that is not the point of this movie. He starts off desperate and hungry for success, and he ends the same way. We only see the slightest suggestions of him becoming more successful, and we see how far he will go for that success - but this is not new, as we see him go just as far in the opening minutes of the film. Though I imagine everyone is expecting the movie and plot to go in a certain direction (because it is an absurdly cliche story that you have seen before in TV shows, other movies, and books), the movie ends up aiming slightly lower to avoid being entirely cliche. I am certain that at some point the writer/director realized that this was just another retelling of an old trope, and tried to edit the ending to make it a tad less obvious. It does not benefit the movie. Taking a trope and making it weaker does not make a strong movie, it makes a forgettable movie. That is what this movie is - incredibly forgettable. But that is not all that is wrong with the writing in this film. Gyllenhaal's character is clearly autistic (and the writer/director has confirmed this is intentional) to the point that this comes off as a hit piece about people with autism. I have worked with people on the spectrum and while Gyllenhaal's portrayal of an autistic protagonist is well done, the writing behind it disastrously misunderstands what autism is. While the writing has Gyllenhaal correctly neglecting enormous social cues, it also portrays him as obscenely manipulative, exercising such enormous control over social situations that it is absurd. To be frank, regardless of how high functioning Jake Gyllenhaal's character is supposed to be, he cannot both be autistic and simultaneously be so ridiculously successfully manipulative in social situations. This movie makes autistic people out to be self centered villains who will stop at absolutely nothing to obtain what they want. It is a disgustingly misinformed examination of autism. At this point you may be wondering why this movie has such high reviews. While it may be due to Jake Gyllenhaal's convincing glass eyed smiles or Renee Russo's believable portrayal of a struggling exec, I think it also has to do with a less impressive aspect of the film. This movie aims for low hanging fruit, criticizing the news media for being exploitative and corrupt. Literally all of America (and much of the world) has an issue with this right now, the only difference from person to person being exactly which stations they think are worse. I am not saying the media does not deserve this criticism (it really does), and the movie does an excellent job at portraying how ratings come before morality - I am just saying that this is the modern equivalent of making an 80's scifi movie where the military and government are the villains. But that is it. A huge cliche aimed at an easy target. A disgustingly inaccurate portrayal of a person with autism. A well directed movie with a very low goal that completely succeeds at what it is trying to do, but will be forgotten by the next day.",1

It does stay on until the water is out and the buttons function wonderfully, just doesn't diffuse as much as I was hoping for.",1

Purchased to use as Martial Arts pants for women that are large. I have lost weight, and needed to go down a size. The sizing chart listed my range in the XL size. Just to be save, I ordered the 1 X size. It was way too tight. Don't trust the sizing chart. I've reordered the 2 x.",1

I’m 5’10, 140 pounds and these were much too short on me. I also didn’t find them to be flattering on my figure. However, the patterns are beautiful and the quality seemed pretty good for the price. Would probably be more flattering on shorten women. I returned these with no issues.",1

"Sorry :(

I was so torn on this book. I wanted to feel it. I wanted to believe the passion, but it just wasn't there. The first 30 or 40% was so SLOW and boring, I had to stop reading, but ended up coming back to it. I'll be honest, I skimmed a lot of this book. A LOT. I just couldn't feel the characters at all and it felt like a filler book? Do you know what I mean? I'm seeing this more and more with these authors that pump out books every 3 months. Sure it makes them money, but their books are a hit or miss with me. It seems as if this was in the miss checklist. It felt like the story was slow but the concept rushed. I know that probably makes no sense, but read it and see. If you are a new to Michaels, don't go for this one right away. Try some of her earlier works.",1

I purchased this because the description says that they can go in the freezer and microwave, unfortunately microwaving these containers has resulted in damage and I had to dispose of some of them. The plastic started flaking in the bottom section if it gets too hot, so if you microwave them be sure to use a lower setting. The lids also cannot be microwaved. Do not drop these because they are very fragile, especially if you're taking them out of the freezer. I have probably a little more than half left that are undamaged at this point.",1

Only had this thing for a month and the lights started randomly flashing and turning on/off in the middle of the night. They are sending me a new one but still only a month for it to have issues?

Nice cover, but the xl is deceiving. I have a big bike, 26"" womens simple seven brand with an aluminum basket on the front. With that said, it is a tight fit. Taking the basket off may help, but who wants to constantly do that. I think I need an xxl. Didn't want the bagginess of a two bike bag either. This bag does not seem xl, even with the oversized handlebars and basket of my simple seven, it is a hard to get on easily fit.",1

"Verdict is still out...

I'd like to say ""wow, love these"" but I can't. It wouldn't take much to turn these into great bibs and I would have paid a bit more to get it. These are better than most $40 bibs, yes, and they are a lot worse than $180 bibs. I'd have rather paid a little more to get a couple minor improvements and then the difference between these and $180 bibs would have been far less and this would be a 5 star review. So where's the area for improvements: 1) In this price range a gel chamois is expected or at least something approximating that sort of density. Sadly I didn't see that in the description it says ""foam"" padding. That's just lame. It really doesn't do much of anything padding wise. 2) While I'm sure it helps from a coolness factor, the bib straps are just too flimsy a material. It isn't the same as the rest of the shorts so it really doesn't pull the shorts up and keep them in position. Better than a drawstring at the waist but just not as functional as a bib should be. If you want bibs that would be great for relatively short rides (padding not so important) in hot weather, these would be ok, but they really aren't up there for more substantial rides.",1

About as good a South Park experience as I think could ever be made; it looks great, is funny, and moves along at a fine pace. If you're a fan of South Park, it's a no-brainer; however, it's not a perfect video game. The difficulty is laughably easy, and overall the RPG elements are good but not great. But, they fit the setting and theme well. Given that the game is not very lengthy, it made for an above average experience overall despite a few flaws. Recommended for fans of the show.",1

Ok, so if you are a tall, svelte, supermodel type this will be fabulous on you. Otherwise you will need to pay to have many inches of fabric taken up from the bottom because it is designed for someone who is maybe 5'10' wearing high heels. I am 5'4"" and prefer lower heels.

It's really great and fun to mess around with, though I have two issues with it. Firstly, the colors for the magic used do not correspond to what it is meant to be. For example gravity is supposed to be purple but on mine it is showing up as red like fire would. Blizzard is meant to be blue but on mine it shows green like cure. My second issue is whenever I try to use the keyhole projection, it's not actually projecting it out. It makes the noises and everything and if I look into the actual part where the light is supposed to come from, I can see it but it won't project out for whatever reason. Other than those, everything else is great!",1

The other built-in modes aside from the footsteps mode felt very underwhelming. Set-up was a breeze. Knob to change the sound level is fantastic.

"Disappointed

I’m giving this a three based on craftsmanship since I just got it. I put it on a couple of days ago with no issues. It fits perfect too. The problem is u can feel where the screen meets the white or black parts on the protector. So moving ur finger across the screen around the borders u can feel the break between the solid color part and the screen. I’ve had lots of these screens and this has never been an issue. So I wouldn’t buy this one again because it’s enough to annoy me. It does come with 2 but it feels the same. I wish the good ones would quit selling them under one name for a few months this taking that product off and putting it up with a different company name, I believe that’s why they all say it’s lifetime warranty replacement, because after 6-7 months u can’t get a hold of them anymore so they don’t have to honor it.",1

I prefer the soft cases because I think it's more comfortable for the cats and easier for me to carry two at a time. But for the money I'm not sure I'm happy enough with this product. Maybe I need to use them a few times but they aren't standing up very well even with the pets in them. When my cat first went in, she managed to open the tiny little side zipper and squeeze out. Additionally because she was so scared in there she rolled over and the board to keep it shaped moved with her. The top seemed to collapse and it wasn't as sturdy as I'd like.",1

I was really excited about this soap bar. It arrived and the smell was fantastic and the quality seemed high. That night I had tried the bar out for about a minute working it into my face. The bar was very hard with sharp corners and not the most user friendly. Withing a minute it began burning my face and left me with a chemical like burn for a few days. It dried my face out after just one use and left me in pain for the next few days. With high expectations I was saddened to have this occur. Although, the company itself has a great ""feel good"" mission with eco friendly packaging and a genuine attempt to deliver products that are good for your body. They have great customer service and overall strive to be the best they can for their customers.",1
"Not beveled as advertised

The sheets are not thinner at the edge as stated in the description. They are the same thickness across and have almost a yellowish tint to it. Because of that they are far more noticeable than another brand I had. They are fine for around the house or at night, but not great if you plan on wearing them out. The only benefit is the medicine i think goes all the way to the edge so its slightly easier getting the smaller patches to fit over larger pimples, where as the other brand the medicine was in the middle and sometimes Id not get the patch quite centered. The sheets are not perforated so you have to carful pull the patch off with your fingernails and hope you dont mess up the edge. These patches work pretty much like the other brand I bought before. Some times they work over night, sometimes i have to use multiple patches back to back and sometimes they don't work at all, mostly on the deep pimples. Over all these are cheap, you get a lot for your money, they work as well as more the expensive brand I tried but they are harder to peal off the sheets and are more visible.",1

"Not As Good As Others

I’ve tried several brands of reusable pads/rounds and these not only didn’t wash clean (I don’t use foundation or waterproof products either), but the non-exfoliating (blue ring) pads are practically resistant to any of my toners. The liquid, no mater how water based/etc., just sits on the surface trying to spill off. I recommend reusable clothes of all kinds and have been using them for two/three years now but these aren’t functional for most skincare. Fine for makeup removal other than the instant staining (which usually takes my other clothes much longer) I suppose. Sad about it tbh. :/ Now if they made a pack solely with the tan ring exfoliating pads? I would buy several packs 100%.",1

Saw a Couple of reviews about this one so I figured I would put my Two cents in. One thing that's great is that it holds a lot of cards without bending them as long as you don't try to move the book around in weird ways and what not. But that's about all this does. The book itself just looks like they took 2 x 20 page monster binders and then slapped them together into one binding, so overall its not really great for people who like to admire their cards frequently. Also, the outside material doesn't seem to be as tough as their other binders that are smaller, I wonder if this is because of the stress of having a larger capacity for cards or what, but the material on my particular binder is already starting to tear apart, but like I said, the cards are in good shape and are protected so I guess this binder is technically doing it's job haha. This Binder overall is great for people who buy/sell/trade a lot of their bulk and need something with a large capacity to carry all of their extra cards around, but if you want something that you can admire your cards in, just get the regular 20 page monster binders.",1

The second section is a quick glossing over of the campaign, not really revealing anything new, but explaining how and why she came to work on the campaign. Finally, she relates another glossing-over of her White House days; again not revealing many previously unreported details. She does have a rather unique perspective as she has known Trump for quite awhile and has been able to observe the mental deterioration during those years.",2
"If you liked Fir Coat...Well, this is almost the same.

I love this brand. The similarity to Fir Coat is a little bit disappointing, and both of those are very close to Salem (although Salem lacks the holographic glitter and has a black base rather than a deep blue, the colors are very close by merit of being dark blue/greens). I've TRIED to provide photos of all three for comparison, but for some reason I'm unable. I like them all and don't regret the purchase at all, it's quite cute and even if it's very close to Fir Coat...well, it's very close to one of my favorites so that isn't exactly a bad thing. As for the brand and the polish quality itself, I love this brand and find it has a lot of staying power even with the considerable abuse that I put it through. It removes well when I want it to, but holds up very well.",2
"Looks awesome and made well

Looks awesome and made well. Looks movie quality. Would give 5 stars but it was slightly snug. Other than that it was perfect",2
"Long Book Full of History and Details

This book book took me some times to read, as it detailed history and the behavior of the Democratic Party. Some of the book I agree with and some I don't. It obviously is one sided, but not without being an education to read.",2
"A top read

Renegade is an amazing book and a start to a wonderful series that I love to re-read every time a new one comes out! Ryan and Whitney are a great and funny couple... there are a ton of laughs and a ton of sweet and definitely heat.... Laramie is one of my automatic one click authors.... I have loved everything she has wrote but the Moonshine Task Force is definitely a top read series for me!",2
"Super cute and a great high waist !

Got these on a whim and I’m super happy ! High waisted and snug.... I’m a hard fit and I may have ordered to big but they still fit great!",2
"Good boards

Nice quality of boards, not slippery After using a while there’re stains which don’t go out but it doesn’t effect its purpose",2
"thank you so much great

Very cute toy. thank you so much great service",2
"Inexpensive

My wife is very please with this.",2
"really good way to hold your phone

The magnets in here are the perfect strength, I can casually toss my phone at it and it will stick. It holds steady without shaking and has not affected my phone at all.",2
"A+

Smells AMAZING and feels super silky and smooth",2
"assembled by purchaser

good little cart for short people",2
"They make it so much more comfortable to hold and move around if you're like me ...

These grips are a lifesaver for magic mice. They make it so much more comfortable to hold and move around if you're like me and have your pinky hanging off the right hand edge. They're sized perfectly and don't obstruct the movement of the mouse, although the rubbery finish collects dirt really easily so I end up wiping them down pretty regularly.",2
"Perfect wedding gift!

This are lovely, but ok only giving it four starts becouse I thought they were going to be a little bigger.",2
"This works well, only issue is that it’s a little bit heavy

This works well, only issue is that it’s a little bit heavy",2
"No backing

Looks, works great, but could use a heavier backing.",2
"Nice sturdy and large

The best litter scoop we've had works great and is nice and large and looks like it will last forever. Feels like the metal handle ends at the bend so I tend to hold it just below the bend where it feels sturdy.",2
"Another funny Louisiana story

Being from Louisiana myself and having married into a Cajun family I really enjoy these stories. This particular one had laughs in the right places, but the development of Miss Prim and Proper was too simple. A writer herself Miss Prim and Proper should have had more interest in just what the ladies past experiences had been. All in all a good read before sleeping.",2
"Snug fit. Nice under clothing-cannot tell

I like that I got a medium and I can make is smaller. I am 5’4 142 and if one wants it tight, you can...and if you want it with a little more breathing room, it can still be adjusted without the need to go up a size.",2
"Confusing settings but good drying brush

It's great to have a brush that also blow dries my hair! It was a little confusing what the 3 settings actually do. Thankfully, the seller sent an email to explain: LOW--Cool Heat & High Air Speed MIDDLE--Warm Temp & Low Air Speed HIGH--Hot Temp & High Air Speed **Please note that the sign of settings indicates the heat and temperature, not the air speed. In other word, there are 3 level of heat and 2 blower speed. It is different from other hair dryer and it is easy for you to have a confused idea that settings are broke. If you encounter this confusion, please be eased. This helped to clear up the confusion. Good product!",2
"Works

Nothing to say here, they're metal plates with adhesive on the back.",2
"A decent buy

The set is cute. My daughter 6 yr old wore it for school and looked so cute. It’s a good deal for all 4 pieces at that price but the quality of the skirt of is very cheap. The skirt is like felt material rather than a better quality. For the price an and being that you get the whole set, purpose was served.",2
"Great space!

Fits perfectly in my large drawer in our kitchen island! Does do some occasional shifting of the extension on the one end but nothing major. Love the open space for each utensil. Holds all our forks, knives, and spoons with space to spare for extra gadgets and our little ones utensils.",2
"This bluetooth is very handy and easy to carry around

This bluetooth is very handy and easy to carry around. What I like about this device is that Selfie don't need to raise your hand far just to get a good picture and struggle pressing that button for the camera. Another thing about this device is that it comes with an extra holder to the bluetooth clicker and you either put it on the stick or your finger, but it is better to put it on the stick for a long range selfie. Another thing i notice about this Universal Wireless bluetooth Camera is that the plus (+) and the minus (-) sign can also work to take a picture. I think it is serve to zoom in zoom out but for my S8 it works as to take a snap shot picture. Design it look sleek and doesn't look cheap to look at. When it comes to emergency photo with a group good to have it around.",2
"Great headphones

I was skeptical at first but these headphones are pretty good for the price. When I put these headphones in they block out all of the outside noise. Sound quality in my opinion is great. The only complaint I have is the part of the headphones that wrap around your ears are pretty flimsy. But other than that these are really good, and I would definitely recommend these before you decide to spend over a $100 for some beats",2
"Cute but no variety

Nice but a couple of multiples out of 6 doesn't give very much variety. They are cute and small.",2
"Four Stars

Product seems to be working.",2
"Excellent

A well written, fast paced story. I have read the first couple of books in this series. This was one of the better ones.",2

Good quality batteries at a fraction of retail prices. Came in small envelope packaging. Did not have any expiration dates shown.",2
"Getting value for my money

That enough for so much money",2
"You can actually see

Can see everything pretty much. Awesome to see deer before I get right up on them. Very bright and very affordable. Highly recommended to the ones that have issues with riding at night.",2
"Four Stars

Somewhat predictable, but still an interesting read.",2
"Great price - delivery was so slow that I forgot ...

Great price - delivery was so slow that I forgot I ordered them so it was a nice surprise to see them sitting on my porch.",2
"Nice

Beautiful!! I really enjoy this product. I wish the top screwed on to be secure but other than that nice product.",2
"2 different sliders; very useful

I assumed these were all the same type of product, usable on both hardwood and carpet floor. There are actually 2 types, half for carpet and half for hardwood. I used the hard sided ones (for carpet?) under my dryer and extremely heavy washer, on our garage which is concrete covered in epoxy. They work great for this purpose! I couldn't even move the washer 1 inch before. Not sure how the felt ones will work. 1 star taken away only for the lack of clarity regarding the product.",2
"True to description

It was exactly as advertised and very comfortable.",2
"Love you Guys

Love you Guys.....BUT don't sent a phoney tried to deliver message because you can't deliver on the date promised. It would have been no big deal! Dont appreciate the fooling around.",2
"Hole-y tea holes that’s grainy

I like them but they are for a pot of tea not just a single cup. My biggest complaint would be that the holes let little bits of tea out into the water.",2
"Highly recommend

Amazing product and the color of the pigment is wonderful.",2
"It is what it is.

Perfect for the mending job.",2
"Great game

An all time family favorite! Customizing the cards used in each game keeps it interesting, especially when I let the kids decide",2
"Good for cleaning cymbals.

I bought this to use as a cleaner for the cymbals on my drum set and I was very happy with the results. Be aware that it will remove the printed labels, so if you are using it as a cymbal cleaner and value the look of the labels, just be careful when using.",2
"Thicker hair

Seems to thicken thinning hair.",2
"Perfect

What my dog eats- good value",2
"Very good product

this has helped my husbands gums a lot",2
"Good, and easy enough to use for the price!

I ordered this to repaint some cabinet doors. They had your typical tongue-and-groove design, making it impossible to paint an even coat without it looking all globby. While I found out the paint I was using was also infuriating other customers (Valspar High Gloss Enamel SUCKS, is NOT ""self-leveling"" or ""easy to clean,"" and chips with the scrape of a thumbnail despite surface prep!) Overall, you have to clean this device quickly in between uses, but for this price point you can seriously knock some extra work and time off of a project that may take days to do the old-fashioned way. It was worth it to me! I will definitely be using it long into the future. Checkout a breakdown of various components below: Anyway, this product was fairly easy to use after perusing the instructions for a bit. While the viscosity cup provided is supposed to help indicate how much to thin your paint, it didn't really work for its intended purpose, as my paint was taking FOREVER to go through the funnel, way beyond any of the indicated times on the instructions. (For example, instructions indicate to add certain amount of water or thinner based on amount of time it takes for the paint to run through the funnel filled to the top). This led to some difficulty in figuring out how much I should dilute my paint, which led to some trial and error. However, most paint cans do have instructions for paint sprayer dilution, so that helped some! >APPLICATION - relatively easy but takes a bit of practice and increasing the velocity of the spray to ensure it is coming out in an even stream and not in splatters, which can also be affected a lot by how much you diluted it. Won't flow correctly if it is too thick. Difficult to do small applications of paint because you have to keep scraping the paint to the bottom of the container for it to be sucked through the straw. >DEVICE ITSELF - turns on easily, but I will say it the motor starts getting pretty hot quickly, which made me a bit nervous to use it for more than a few minutes at a time. Parts are all easy to assemble/reassemble. >CLEANING - While the parts are easy to clean, I frequently wished that I could put it down and come back to it later in between coats. Paint can be left in the reservoir if you seal it well with plastic wrap, but you have to run water through the sprayer otherwise it will get all dried up VERY fast with water-based paint once you turn it off. You 100% NEED a straw-cleaning bristle brush to clean the sprayer channels that don't detach from the device if anything dries up, otherwise globby and half-dried paint starts going through the nozzle and screwing up the spray pattern.",2
"perfect!

I highly recommend it.",2
"Great Make - Not Very Shiny

Great! Except I thought the aluminum letters would be shinier. More like chrome. However I think the duller looks better on the front of my car 🤷🏼‍♀️",2

I came in the middle of the series but still enjoyed the story and characters.",2
"Awesome

Daughter loves it, great quality and fast shipping. Would buy from this vendor again.",2
"Good and LONG

Still not sure why people are so scared of Pennywise, but I did enjoy the movie. I haven't seen the new one, but I watched this intentionally beforehand so that I could review both. It was entertaining, but SUPER long lol",2
"Cranberries sweetened without sugar

Good flavor and no added sugar.",2
"Love the smell

Love the smell, keep it in stock all the time. I have a dog I rescued at age 10 who had zero house training and has never gotten perfect at it in years. I have stinky carpet. I also have a Lab who is just big and stinky and a cat. This will freshen up a room.",2
"Four Stars

Great addition to my decks!",2
"Great value.

Great and handy chair",2
"Awesome surge protector/adaptor

Always a good (and sometimes required) investment for expensive tech. I always try to use a surge protector on all my tech so nothing happens to it. I would recommend against using this outside as it is not a sealed unit. It is also great to use to save money on your electricity bill, you are able to turn everything off at once. I do with the outlets were more separated so you can fit multiple blocks beside each other and not have to waste an outlet.",2
"Great price real results

This product does work however u have to bomb spray vacuum wash or nothing will work",2
"Larger than expected.

I liked the color and idea of a tube but when I received it, it was heavier and a little larger than expected. I returned it because I did not feel it was going to work well for my travel plans.",2
"This is a good, deep black nail polish.

Just the black that I needed. I do my nails as a hobby and was looking for a good black nail polish that was opaque with just one layer for doing designs and such. Saw lots of reviews that the Onyx Black from OPI was just what I needed, so I gave it a whirl and it works! One layer and it's completely opaque so it's perfect for patterns and designs. Came in a timely manner as well. I had just bought two other OPI colors from a shop that day so I felt spoiled.",2
"Good value

Good value until you realize that they’re all small measurement cups. I do mean “small”!",2
"Love it!

Love the idea of this powder to carry in my purse because my compact pressed powders always crack. So far I really like it but I feel the powder does not come out good enough. I bang it on the table to try to prime the powder on the brush but it comes out so sparingly. I’m in South Florida and need a lot of powder on my face. Maybe I’m not doing it right but I continue to use it and like it. I have a powder sunscreen in the same type of applicator and it comes out generously.",2
"Great deal for the money

Great price. Fast delivery. Exactly as described. Love the extra batteries. Perfect.",2
"Four Stars

it fits well with the exception it is a bit snug across the shoulders and bust area",2
"Four Stars

Good book, I enjoyed reading it.",2
"Five Stars

These are a nice metalic gold. Very pretty.",2
"Love it!

This is so easy to install and looks great! It does tend to lean forward because the camera makes it top heavy.",2
"Good purchase

I had been looking for a regular blender for a long time (nothing fancy just something to make milkshakes and smoothies for the family) when I came across this one. It's definitely a great value. The pitcher isn't made of cheap plastic like some other blenders. It's very easy to clean and to use.",2
"Many uses for this foam tape

I originally bought this to close gaps around the top of my exterior doors. Since then, I've also discovered it works well for closing up gaps at the bottom (threshold) of my door, and around the sides as well. It sticks well and is very easy to use.",2
"Five Stars

This is a nice case, inexpensive and fits perfectly.",2
"Tiny but versatile

Its smaller than what I expected but gives a decent amount of perfectly cooked rice (perfect for 1 or 2 persons). Its easy to clean and takes up very little space. Good product for low price. Highly recommended!",2
"Anecdotal evidence is almost my life in a nutshell.

Like that is was simple and straightforward and the strategies can be implemented right away with ease.",2
"Its working fine

I'm restringing a necklace that had cord & leather. The leather gave out. So far so good.",2
"So happy!

I’m so happy I finally bought this stroller!!! It’s so much smoother and lighter than my BOB single stroller. It’s perfect, I highly recommend it for running. It folds up easy and takes up less room than my BOB as well. If you are looking for a stroller to go shopping ( in and out of doors ) this is not for you as it’s too big to fit through normal doorways you the tiniest bit. If you, like me just wanted a stroller to pop in the trunk to go for a run this is the one for you.",2
"Nice product.

Nice product. I purchased this privacy screen for my office and it has helped tremendously with prying eyes. I had to make sure the measurements were accurate and when this came, fit perfectly! This screen is not too dark that I didn't have to adjust my light level to see. I liked this feature as well. Once I started using this, everyone stopped looking at my screen when they talk to me. Now I don't have to close everything or lock my screen when I get visitors in my office. Wonderful!!",2
"Another enjoyable read

Looking forward to the next volume in this series.",2
"Little lighter weight material than expected

Good quality, versatile fit. Very good value compared to other belts.",2
"Slim laundry basket

My kids all have their own laundry hampers. My daughters broke and so I got this one, I like that it is slim and fits in a small place. It's not huge but I didn't want huge because that means I let the laundry build longer. Great hamper!",2
"Five Stars

Very sturdy and does the job keeping the dogs out!",2
"Good product, larger than expected.

Good product, does what it needs to, it is however quite a bit bigger than I expected, not an issue, just leaves about an inch of unused space inside it, in saying that however this thing could hold a pretty big canister of pepper spray.",2
"Love this guy!

Such beauty in that voice",2
"Great product.....

Installed the first of four of them I ordered and I learned not to tighten down collar too tight or the ""loose"" collar above it is difficult to align for the camera. Other than that, pretty easy to install.",2
"Good for the money. Long install

This is a pretty decent dvd shelf. It's a bit of a pain to install since it requires several tools. You need a screwdriver and a hammer to fit it together. Also, the shelves aren't wobbly at all, but I believe the included wall mount is required for stabilizing. All in all, this is a fine particle board shelf.",2
"these are pneumatic

I thought they were solid but they were not, and I see it is in the description so my bad, product was as represented",2
"good vibration, easy to clean

High quality product, good vibration, easy to clean.",2
"Fantastic!

Actually works really great. I also put it on my eye brows and works great there too! ;-)",2
"Does the job

We only use the clock for time, not as an alarm. The letters are large and easy to read from across the room. However, even the dim setting is pretty bright. I would prefer something even dimmer to minimize the amount of light in the bedroom. The power cable has uses a USB connection but does not include a USB power adapter in the box.",2
"Fits well, has 3 settings

Fit my Revlon hair dryer well. Doesn’t wobble or move at all. I like that it has 3 air flow settings. Overall I’m happy with my purchase.",2
"The Wood Nymph By Mary Balogh

I gave this book a four star rating because it lacked an epilogue, however I would recommend this book to all romantic readers because it had most of the important elements of a good read.",2
"Four Stars

Plastic piece and works as described. You get what you pay for.",2
"Familiar

This story is awfully familiar; I may have bought it before, under a different title or author name?' Anyway, it was good. It was short. Nice characters. Not that much emotion but I can make up for that in my mind. I couldn't see any obvious editorial mistakes. The dialogue read as natural, not stilted. It was a good idea having a character who can see real magical creatures under their human disguises and I guess having him shut away in a facility because of it, is a natural story progression. The elf was fun..",2
"Four Stars

Works great once I figured out how to configure my new TV to switch to optical audio out.",2
"Good alarm battery

Replaced my dead battery. Need one day to charge. Works great",2

Very Nice and large bag exactly what we need to store our christmas tree in for the off season",2

I had a lot of mood swings before and this stuff helped alleviate that. It's just my first week of usage and I'm impressed already. I guess I'll be keeping a stock of this product",2
"Great maintenance soap

Good soap, specially for the price. Nothing too premium but great for maintenance washes with some wax in it.",2
"Not precise equipment, but gets the job done.

just a couple of comments here on an inexpensive and useful device: in case you wonder, this device plugs into a three-prong outlet, just like the plug it accepts from the controlled device. I wondered if I needed to connect it like a new outlet, or plug it into an outlet - now I know and so do you. Also, the time-adjustment knobs are not too well calibrated perhaps - well the off time seems about right, but the on time is spectacularly off: when I set it for one minute it stayed on for over eight minutes. But when I tweaked it down to thirty seconds, it stayed on for 90 seconds. Not linear, so you may have to fiddle with it to get the desired operation. Mine runs a 1/4 horsepower water pump.",2

Family pictures might just be the bane of my existence. Trying to find an affordable but talented photographer combined with having to get my kids and husband looking like we haven't just been hit by a bus is a task of Herculean effort.

Plus the tripod makes it easy for my kids to record videos for family, go live on social media and it works as a selfie stick so that we can take pictures on the go!!! This is such a great value for such a high quality product!",2
"GREAT READ..... PAMELA DOES NOT DISAPPOINT

Ms. Samuels Young never disappoints. I recieved an email about the e-release for this book. I immediately downloaded it as I make it a point to read all of her books. I read the first page of this book and was immediately hooked. I READ THE ENTIRE BOOK IN FOUR HOURS. This is one of her by far best writes. She pushes to a new extreme of erotic suspense and has done an amazingly great job at it. The sex scenes are steamy and the order of events are not your typical guess what happens next. You will not be disappointed. I would love a part II to this book... Keep them coming Pamela!",2
"Light weight, fast charge!

I love this charger. I purchased one for myself, then one for my husband, the two more for my daughters.",2
"I gonna love it.

If you are looking for some extension bit for your screwdriver, check this one out. I am expecting an extension bid holder for a while. And this one is new to me. Flexible! That means you can bend it to fit your needs. I gonna love it.",2
"Good value stand

This is a sturdy stand for my Iphone X. The four pads attached to the stand provides stability and protection for my device. The viewing angle for Iphone X is excellent when placed horizontally or vertically. I ordered the red stand and it looks great, however, the finish was not perfect. The bottom peg was not fully coated. Overall, a good product at an affordable price.",2
"Good for toiletries while traveling

These are really convenient travel bags. I like the various sizes. I used to use a large toiletry bag which took up a lot of space. These bags carry the same amount of stuff but can be dispersed throughout your suit case. They're pretty durable and work for toiletries.",2
"works great!

Original product,works great!",2
"works better than it looks

When I first brought this thing out of the box I was pissed, because it looks more like a toy than an effective piece of equipment...but don't let the look fool you. This thing is pretty hard core it's at least as bright as any other spot that I've owned, the flashlight option is also bright , and it takes and holds a charge for a long time.",2
"easy to clean

It came as it was described.",2
"Fantastic writing draws the reader into the characters' lives

Best described as historical fiction, although not in the romantic sense, this novel is exceedingly well written. I was pulled into Charles' life from the first page. I loved the development of the character, Charles, and his alter ego Bulldog. I did not find the story dull or slow moving, as the critical reviewers did - the pace was just right for me. The writing is an integral part of the story, as Charles is an aspiring reporter. Entertaining and immersive, there is also some suspense and tension as Charles becomes involved with not one but 2 crime families on his way to realizing his dream.",2
"Leaves Mouth Clean Feeling

Mouth and teeth feel really good and clean after using. Charged battery lasts a long time and the flosser is easy to store and travel with. It does leak a little though while using and a little difficult to grasp without slipping or accidentally turning off, but I should get use to holding it properly.",2
"Great fit, very comfortable

It was just as expected, I love it!",2
"Great value, perfect stand for my laptop...

This tripod worked out perfect for my 15-inch laptop. I didn’t have any place for the mouse pad or power supply thou. I found another seller that has selves that clamp onto the OD of the tripod, problem solved! The tripod is sturdy and isn’t expensive either. I’d recommend it to anyone.",2
"solid, heavy, sturdy

This spinosaurus is solid, sturdy and heavy, looks very nice. lower jaw can move. only complaint is the teeth are a little fragile, some teeth fell off after playing with it for a few days.",2
"Almost a match made in heaven

I Really like it, but it’s not quite a love story; it’s very powerful, for something so small, and lightweight. However, the combination of how/where the hose exits the canister, and the size and number of wheels on the bottom, lead to a continual nuisance of tipping over. The plastic lever for switching out attachments is very cheap plastic, and broke as I was unpacking the vacuum. This may be a huge issue for some, but I don’t ever use attachments, so for me, no harm, no foul. The location of the power switch is a bit problematic as well, considering the other switch located in the mirror position on the back of the canister, causes the cord to retract. I’ve done this no less than 500 times. And no, for clarity, I am not a slow learner. That said, I do in fact, love that the vacuum has a retractable cord. I realize it is trivial, but for me, the winding and wrapping of a loose cord is just irritating. Not difficult, irritating. So the fact I don’t have to wind and wrap and wind and wrap, I’ll give it a star back, for the convenience it provides. Overall though, the pros far outweigh the cons.",2
"Pretty!

I bought two sets of these to fill six empty ear piercings. Overall, I’m happy. They are very pretty, and they match my more expensive white opal jewelry. Packaging: each set comes in its own small plastic bag sealed with an adhesive strip. There was nothing holding the individual pieces in place, but at least the balls were all screwed on. Luckily, there was no scratches on the material. Putting them in: difficult. One of the balls was stuck on and I couldn’t get it to budge at first. I almost considered returning one set but I was able to get t off after about 10 minutes of trying. Putting them in was challenging because I can’t see behind my ear of course. I’ve been wearing them for a couple weeks now, and I am still pleased. I have very sensitive skin, and I’ve experienced no irritation. The balls have not loosened, and the jewels still fit securely in their settings. I originally wanted to get real white gold jewelry, but I’m not sure I’ll need to anytime soon.",2
"Bought 2 of these for husband to stretch out

Quality mats and easy to keep clean. Replaced bulky old blue tri-fold gym mat - simple to roll up and store or just leave out in basement and also in bedroom. Very supportive and looks nice!",2

"Pretty good for the price

After a few weeks, the right side stopped working on the first pair I purchased. Anker's customer support is very good though, replacement was sent to me quickly and haven't had any issues with the 2nd pair. I like that it comes with 4 different sizes of the piece that goes in your ear, and the part that you plug in is slightly less bulky than other similar headphones I've tried. They stay pretty comfortable even when wearing them for long periods of time, and the sound quality is as good as I'd expect for a $40 pair. I'll give this 5 stars if this second pair is still working in 6 months with no problems.",2
"Easy to use but does not get 100% all areas you desire to have cleaned up.

It was easier to install this product then to drill the pop rivets out of the original part. I was repairing an old self propelled Toro for my dad that let it sit for 4 years and broke the pull start trying to get it running again. So alot of pulling on this to get it all ready for him.",2
"You may hate it or love it, but it will not bore you.

If some of these reviewers are looking for great literature: Learn Greek. I read this novel when it first came out in paperback in the early sixties. It has held up to the test of time as far as a novel goes. The sex and violence is not as new nor shocking as it was in those days. I think we have all become a bit jaded. Characters are well written, a novel to enjoy reading just for the sake of reading. A book that keeps your attention and moves right along.",2
"This is what i need!!

It’s a mazing as i need. It will be perfect if there is 2 sizes because it will useful for the kids also.",2
"Super cute

My 8 year old loooves Shopkins, and she was absolutely beside herself when she opened this on Christmas Day. The car that goes with it was out of my price range for Christmas, but I will be looking for it to go on sale and snag it when/if it does. Really cute little camper set, decent price.",2
"Works great.

This one works great on my LG phone. It's small size and very portable. I like the white color. Nothing to complain.",2
"Very nice, especially for the price

Love this unit especially for the price. The only issue that I have is the clock will not keep the correct time. I set it and within 4 or 5 seconds it changes itself back to the original incorrect time. 5 stars if I could fix this.",2
"Perfect for zooming away your pesky whiskers

This is far the best product i have ever purchased. I highly recommend it.",2
"Wonderful story

Love, suspense, sacrifice, this book has it all!",2
"Nice EDC tool but needs a couple mods.

The retraction feature was annoying because you couldn't apply any pressure without the blade disappearing. I yanked out the spring with a small screwdriver... just get under there and yank it till it breaks free. I also replaced the blade with harder carbide steel. I use it quite often and it's part of my EDC.",2
"Quality Product

My husband and I like the blanket. It is a quality product. We have the full size blanket. I am waking up feeling more rested. I wear an activity tracker and have noticed my restful sleep time has increased since I started using it.",2

Awesome series! Great characters moving storyline. Universe move over Jack Forge has arrived!",2
"Four Stars

Blade was kind of dull. But otherwise fine.",2
"easy

For decorating and it is easy to use and looks nice.",2
"Good basic fitness watch

I really like this fitness watch. I like that it tracks my steps, heart rate, and sleep. My only issues that I’ve ran into have been that I hit something once that started a timer and for an hour it ran while I tried to figure out how to turn it off. I still don’t know how it came on and how it eventually turned off. The charger is a little bit of a pain. Other than that I really like the watch itself. It also is at a great price!",2
"Not bad but..! Fast delivery

everything is good all over fast delivery except, equality and the size the fabric too thin and size you should order two sizes larger than what you required",2
"A little cheap feeling but they sound fantastic

These are actually lighter and slightly smaller (ear cups) than the previous generation. These also feel a little flimsy but they sound fantastic. The microphone is crystal clear. I can't comment on the battery life yet.",2
"Good quality

Kept my hubby & son warm and comfortable during snow activities. True to size & snug fit; will definitely buy again.",2
"Great looking and feel

My fiance loves his cigar case and the quality is quite impressive. We're going to treat it with distilled water as others have suggested. Great value for the money spent!",2
"Great product.

I’ve always liked these for making decals reusable.",2
"Decent gear.

My Uber passengers like it. Only charges one phone at a time though.",2
"Five Stars

Works very well was able to video complete softball game.",2

Good desk. Very sturdy. Easy to assemble. Didn't like how the keyboard tray slides out, but I didn't need that anyway.",2

Does the job giving support. And adjustable when it loosens up.",2
"Great price

Fit the product just as described.",2
"Excellent Lawn Fungus Treatment

Works great 2 applications a week apart and fungus is gone.",2
"Great versatility

I bought this, not for a baby but because I'm a nurse and I'm always looking for a good, dependable bag for all my stuff. This bag did not disappoint!",2
"Great product at a great price

A quality dual wall heat shrink that shrinks up great, and makes a tight bond.",2
"Very pretty necklace, but not too ""sugary sweet""!

Very pretty. Adjustable chain size is a plus, but lace could be longer to surround back of neck a bit more.",2
"Great product with a lot of lighting

Such a beautiful light! Gives off so much light and looks great. Well worth the price.",2
"soft and cute

It was just a teensy bit small, the fabric is thin but makes it very soft. I love it! I've had a difficult time finding team bandanas, and the price was great! I will update after some wear and tear....",2
"Great kitchen scissors

I bought these after my kitchen scissors broke. These are VERY sturdy, easily break into two pieces for cleaning, and are fluid to use.",2
"Sooo good you won't believe it but you will when you taste your food !

For keto cuisine its fantastic. For everyone Its high quality is wonderful.",2
"Very Good!

Really is a well built product overall. Only wish that the velcro pad on back side was larger and the actual pad size was larger.",2
"Amazing for BTS Army

Perfect upgrade comparing to my previous LG phone",2
"great deal

came well packaged and fits perfectly in my lunch bag. They don't take up much room in the fridge as they are small and stackable",2
"Awesome thermometer, good price, battery life just ok.

This is a little confusing at first, but once you get it all set up, it's great. Only thing that I would recommend to extend battery life would be to get rid of display on the wireless sensors. Other than that, exactly what I was looking for.",2
"Good for toddler and travel pillows

They fit any toddler pillow and never fall out (due to envelope style), which is great. A little long on the edges for my pillows, but a decent buy.",2
"Amazing 3rd party band option over ticwatch pro

Amazing 3rd party option over ticwatch pro wristbands.The magnet is strong, sturdy and cute,easy to resize band size.Reasonable price and great quality. Highly recommend to anyone looking for more wristbands to use on their ticwatch pro.",2

"Delivered on time and packed securely.

Lovett! Ordered earrings for my daughter. Just what she was looking for. A great gift for the holidays.",2
"A great book light.

I attached it to the book and it lit up the hole paperback book. Tried it on a hardback book and used both lights and it lit up the book. Great light.",2
"Great little bag

I love this compact bag, but the cell phone pocket is too small for my phone:( Otherwise it is very roomy for cash, credit cards and a few other essentials. Perfect when you don't want to carry a big purse.",2
"Four Stars

Like the jacket because it has so many pockets! The jacket is very comfortable and warm!",2
"Nice accent for a place setting

Nicely made bling napkin wrap. Easy to assembly with the attached velcro closure.",2
"Does well with small strips:

Worked well on one door but not the other.",2
"Great quality! Fast shipping.

Great quality! Fast shipping.",2
"Organic

Wish they came with a paper tube in the middle rather than the thin stick for tapping down the insides. Love the tube.",2
"Blocks out the light! Super soft.

Loved this sleep mask. I have used lots of different sleep masks in the past, and this by far has been my favorite. Its adjustable , soft and keeps all the light out. I like the eye pads are concave so it's not resting right on your eyes.",2
"Four Stars

great to neat'n up computer Desk.",2
"MTG capable

I got this bag to carry my commander decks and a few other things. Positioning the dividers are a pain to move around but they do their job well once in place. I was a tad disappointed with the fact that only the 2 sides open to the main compartment, and didnt open on one whole side. Also, another neat thing is, if you have the hips for it, you can also wear it like a hip bag so it's more out of the way and everything is still easy to grab. Other than that, fairly good bag, very durable",2
"Exactly as described

Exactly as described. Worked well.",2
"Well made and sturdy

Very nice to store bills",2
"Great quality

These gift boxes were so cute! Very good quality. My only complaint is that it did not come with directions on how to fold them properly. I eventually figured it out but took me a few tries.",2
"Compactable and light weight

Very compactable and light weight. The stakes are durable and tie out points are well made. Wish it had a few more tie outs on the sides. Mine only came with one on each corner, one in the middle of each side and a center tie out. Used this as a lean-to shelter over my tent. The heat from the fire rolled right into my tent and was very comfortable in 24 degree weather. I pulled, wrenched and stretched this tarp with no issues. Also love that it is very easy to fold back up into its pouch.",2
"Good phone case gets the job done

Good phone case gets the job done. Cheap. Holds up to 3 cards. I had this case for the iPhone 6 but the only problem for the 8 is that it’s pretty bulky.",2
"They work!

I can walk normally on icy sidewalks and streets. They fit over my boots easily and stay put. I took one star off because they look a bit flimsy and I don’t know how long they’ll last",2
"Four Stars

Edges wear off easily. Center graphic is slightly fuzzy in appearance. Otherwise great.",2
"It's about a 3 beer install

Awesome piece of equipment. Works better than my OEM Harley equipment. Only problem I have is when the sun shines on the screen. Can't see what's being displayed very well, easy to work around though.",2
"I love it

It's like a microwave 2.0 I use this a lot. Awesome for tofu! No seasoning needed and makes it crispy.",2

"Four Stars

Looks great. Easy to install. Will probably buy again for additional storage needs.",2
"Works good

Needed a dial indicator to build a rear end didn’t want to spend a fortune this worked great for that",2
"Good for dial tone tests

We no longer have any landline phones but do have a landline for another purpose which requires occasional troubleshooting. This somewhat barebones device allows for us to test for a dial tone and make and receive a test call, exactly what we needed it for.",2
"netvue camera

i can't get picture from my phone to my pc. Has an excelent picture.",2
"Great Bargain

Product is great, especially for the price. The only negative is that it is a sticker and I wish it were engraved. We have had this license plate for almost 2 years now and it is holding up perfectly, I do not notice any signs of wear. I would purchase this again.",2
"Nice house slippers.

These are very comfortable and I really like them all but the slick soles. I put the skid resistance stickers on them and they help but the don't stay on long.",2
"Comfortable to hold, firm and quality

This brush is the perfect size to hold in your hand, and the bristles are firm but not too rough. It also comes with a little adhesive hook for your bathroom wall!",2
"I can breathe!

Really helps lung oxygen intake. You can feel it",2
"WORKS GREAT

I ALSO BOUGHT THE REQUIRED CABLE. I DID BUILD MY OWN MOUNTING POLE IT WORKS GREAT",2

I would give it 5 stars, except the traffic updates require a subscription service, contrary to what I was led to believe in the product description.",2
"Love it

So far so good. It came right on time.",2
"Four Stars

Very nice, well made.",2
"Decent USB 3.0 drive for the right price

This USB 3.0 compatible DVD drive was very easy to install and worked well right out of the box. The optical reader can be a little noisy but that's a minor inconvenience. Does exactly what it's supposed to do, in a very thin form factor.",2
"Kind of wish they had an indicator with M T W Th F S Su or something like that instead of numbers

helps me to remember to take my vitamins every day. Kind of wish they had an indicator with M T W Th F S Su or something like that instead of numbers.",2
"Does a great job.

It is lightweight and easy to use.",2
"Easy

Works. And so easy to stow, transport. We all love it. I see another in our future.",2

More bleed through than I'd like. Will look for a different journal when I'm done with this one.",2
"Works Flawless!

Easy to install. I get many compliments on the look of the button sitting on my countertop. Some reviews commented on the plastic material and how it feels cheap. I was skeptical as well once the product arrived. Works flawless! Once installed the product looks like the expensive big boxes brand. No issues pushing the button to turn on/off",2
"Love the design of the toy.

Bought it as a gift for my friend’s kid, who seemed amazed and happy at the design that was different from many of his other spiderman toy figurines.",2
"Wrap it up!

This set works out great for boxing all the gifts up. The gift tags were nice too. An all around good set for the money",2
"Fun

A game that makes you use your brain.",2
"Nice little case.

This is such a great starter case for those just started their essential oil collection. The case is padded so oils will stay protected and it also has a handle. The case also comes with all the roller balls, droppers, key and funnel as described. I bought the bright pink case. I should have bought two because mine is already filled.",2
"Five Stars

Exactly what was discribed",2
"Definitely buy!

My daughters eyes lit up with joy when she seen this. She loves it and its well made.",2
"Cheaply made

This item is not very strong. Looks very fake.",2
"Effective Tool, Well Built, Worth It

This has been a huge hit for my sales team. It’s taken our customer engagement events to another level. It’s built well, sturdy, and easy to use. Super pleased with the purchase.",2
"Ok

For the price serviceable",2

This game feels real and it is very scary. I got so scared I quit the game I found like 6 ghosts in 1 room.",2
"Amazing desk for student or anyone..

Amazing laptop/pc desk... it is sturdy enough to keep a monitor and a laptop together at a same time.. assembly was relatively easy though it took a while.. material feels quite nice.. overall it is a great desk for student to organize stuff..",2
"so cute

i have bought these shorts in multiple prints. they are so fun and the fabric is soft. i give the 4 stars instead of 5 because they do ride up a bit when you walk so i find myself tugging them frequently but i still love them. if i drop a few lbs maybe the ride up won't be an issue. i'll update the review if/when i drop the weight. LOL",2
"Great for Pokemon hunting

I got this power bank to keep my iPhone charged when I am outdoor hunting Pokemon. The game drains a lot of battery so getting a portable power bank is the only way to go. I like the packaging and the design of the power bank. It looks simple but doesn't look cheap. Looks and feels much better than most of the power bank I came across in the past. I used it this weekend to go Pokemon hunting. At the end of the day, I only used a quarter of the charge and my phone is at 100% all the time. Great capacity!",2
"Perfect gift

My friend just got s9 and what could be the better gift than this? The case was good leather touch and feel to it. Comes with a wristlet and credit card slots and 1 ID slot. I put on her phone which was easy to do so without any hassle. It also has a good value to it, my friend liked it.",2
"A decent box for the price.

It works well. Comes with everything to get started except for remote control batteries.",2
"I have been very satisfied with my purchase

I have been very satisfied with my purchase. Holds everything from my iPhone and kindle to an iPad. I would highly recommend this product.",2
"Nice product

Worked right out of the box. I have an 18v Dewalt drill. Would give 5stars, but I haven’t tried to charge them yet.",2
"Great deal

I used this on my bed as a cover for my mattress under my fitted sheet and I love it it has deep pockets so it doesn’t slip of my mattress constantly",2
"Great product

Have worked great for what we have needed them for. Have gone through the dishwasher with no problems.",2
"Great cart

works great - just wish it had netting on the front also",2
"Great!

Grandpa bill was flattered and he loves it!",2
"It's cool.

I like the remote-controlled car very much, and my daughter is happy to have something new to play with, just like any child. It was everything we expected, transportation and customer service exceeded our expectations. They are great! It could cross the grass or climb a hill. It's a good remote-control car. It's cool.",2
"Four Stars

Wish there was more pressure. But that may be on my end.",2
"Great Replacement Cabin Air Filter for a 2016 Toyota Sienna LE

"Bought it for my mother, as she asked for ...

Bought it for my mother, as she asked for my old one. They are LARGER then I remember. The cord is flat and wider than normal, and should last longer.",2
"Best air fryer I've had

I like this air fryer a lot. It's so easy to use, to clean and fast to make any simple yet delicious dishes. Our favorite dish using this air fryer is chicken wings. It came out with crispy skins and juicy meat. I had another air fryer bought from best buy before and that one was cheaply made. It lasted for only 2 months. So I decided to buy a more expensive and bigger one from Amazon. I've had it for a month and everything is functioning well so far. I'll keep posted if anything changes.",2
"Perfect

Exactly what i needed.",2
"Doesn’t smell like pineapple

It’s a nice squishy and looks like my mom’s favorite bread so that was a win, but it didn’t smell like pineapple at all. It had more of a chemical smell to it which isn’t good. I didn’t get it for the smell but it is a bit off putting and I’m sure it’ll fade in time.",2
"Interesting enough story

But maybe l an a snob. Being trained as an editor there is nothing in e-books that drives me crazier than typos, punctuation errors, incorrect words... For example 'he' instead of 'the'-those little things that autocorrect won't catch. One error of that type in a book: ""Okay, it happens."" Two: ""Geez!"" Multiples and l want to take and shake someone. Will l check out the next book in this series? Possibly. Will l continue with it if the editing is no better? Highly doubtful.",2
"Liked better than other whitening strips

Did the job as described. Liked better than other whitening strips. Easy to use.",2

"Miss the paper cover and lyrics

Great product, but still missing the standard cover with lyrics.",2
"Impressive universal stylus

I've tried the Apple Pencil and it's good for certain applications but I didn't like the cost. I thought I'd try this one out and am pleasantly surprised. It's great that this stylus works with all devices old and new. I use this with an older ipad that doesn't support the new pencils. It's pretty accurate and let's me do more detailed things such as drawing or writing. It's easy to charge through the micro usb port. Another great feature is that the top/eraser part of the stylus works without battery. Overall, this is a nicely thought out stylus for a good price.",2
"Great So Far

I liked how easy it was to apply and made a difference right away.",2
"protects like it should - brilliant.

This is simply a fantastic protector, I live in Brazil, and I am an expert in dropping my phone, I think 2 weeks after I got my phone and applied the screen protector it fell from a table to concrete, with screen down, it showed a small crack in the protector only on the edge, afterwards, I have dropped more times on asphalt and finally it fell on cobble stone, the protective screen got many cracks and in the end it started impairing use, so I took it off, amazing how it just glues to the screen. Once I took it off and cleaned my screen, the screen on the Honor 6X is completely as new. Highly recommended, really protects.",2
"Happy customer

Everything was as stated. Recommend for anyone who needs more bands for there Apple Watch.",2
"Fits as advertised

Baby girl is all set for another winning season.",2
"Seems ok

Product seems okay. Made from flexible rubberized plastic so hopefully it will withstand my 2 year old. Only issue is I ordered the Lava Red and they look mostly yellow with a slight red tint.",2
"Not Consistently Bright

It's nice to have the remote control, but it doesn't work if you're more then ten or so feet away. The lights are cute, but start much brighter and dim down along the line (as seen in the photo - the beginning and end of the lights are shown). The color is a warm white/yellow, but it doesn't send out much light. Would be happier if the lights were consistently bright.",2
"Four Stars

Relatively good price for what you get. Simple to use.",2
"Love the flowers

Have patience putting it on! Love the flower pattern.",2
"Fantastic great read

The book started out slow, but you really understood the characters, then I could not put the book down. It was a terrific story!",2

Great book with lots of inspiration! The recipes are very detailed, easy to follow and helpful. I have tried some recipes of this book and all smoothies were delicious and healthy.",2
"Very stiff

Might have to wash a few times",2
"Great stuff, give it a shot.

Great flavor and not ridiculously spicy! Hard to find such a nice combination in a hot sauce. Highly recommended. Pretty cool bottle and label too!",2
"Definatly large and nice to have extra room for a larger sleeping bag

Definatly large and nice to have extra room for a larger sleeping bag. Will not fit a queen size sleeping bag but it will hold a larger outfitter style setup no problem. I matched it with the xxl cot matress from them also and a very good buy",2
"Love it! Great Quality!

Love it!! Keeps cold and hot drinks the same temp for a long long time. Does not leak. Dropped it a few times tho but still works perfectly fine! Would definitely buy another one!",2

Product delivery speed is very fast, very bright with the quality of goods, bang bang weight is also very heavy, and the installation is simple, stable, are used in real materials, some problems are not easy to find, for a period of time after the use of additional comments from you, thank you",2
"Isn't as flush as I'd like it so it's had to get perfect cuts

They're decent little cutters. I used it for a model I was building and needed a cheap replacement till I could find my sturdier ones. Held up surprisingly well and did a decent job leaving smooth cuts. Isn't as flush as I'd like it so it's had to get perfect cuts. Not sure how good these would be at cutting wire but I imagine they'd do alright.",2
