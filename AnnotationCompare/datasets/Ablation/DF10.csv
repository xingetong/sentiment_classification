If you play permadeath you can literally wind up doing nothing but the tutorial over and over again because you can get killed easily during the tutorial.,0
I also hate that dorms where 100 people live are favourable to single dorm rooms which is the opposite of the real world and took a min to wrap my head around.,0
This has soft locked one of my saves as it now crashes on load up.,0
"So, you googled No Man's Sky and you read all the bad stuff that happened at launch: you think that the game is thrash, fair enough, it used to be this way.",0
the intriguing parts of the story were the surreal sequences and the hints at a larger narrative on the store page and the community hub.,0
"I think that improving the atmosphere would go a long way, adding more dialogue, making the different squad members have personality and banter. So far everything feels muted.",0
 There were some very easy puzzles here and there but mostly it was just clicking and dragging. ,0
the guilt for not having pvp ,0
What a pathetic waste to have billions of planets and not be able to enjoy it with dedicated servers hosting 1000's of players.,0

I played the new update and it makes me hate this game more than I did the first time I reviewed it.,0
I guess these could be standard for games that use flight stick controllers ,0

"Your ship and suit used to have three sections: inventory, tech, and protected storage (a few slots protected from you dying). Simple and had the nice feature that you could put tech items in the inventory space as well to trade carrying capacity for more mobility, shields, etc. No need to worry about that choice anymore. Inventory is inventory and tech is tech and protected storage is gone--just like all your stuff if you die.",0
"needs options for aa methods, post process effects (vignette, dof etc.) instead of putting them all under a few sliders and not knowing that they actually enable/disable for what quality setting?",0

"with only vague references to actual diseases,",0
"I like the game but I cannot play it until they fix the saving issue, some of the levels do not save progression and I cannot do other missions because of it.",0
"I like the concept of the superbug network and the global initiatives, but I wish there were a way to complete some of the smaller tasks on your own instead of forcing you to have in-game friends help you complete the projects.",0
"It's just lack of engagement, like a rewarding system that will make people play it again and again. Why don't they give some reward if you beat certain map with certain score? That way, people will strive for that S score and keep playing and learning the game. ",0
"Every time I log in to play now the game freezes or crashes. I have done everything I can to fix update drivers, uninstall and then reinstall, lower the settings, and even follow some online guides. None of it has worked so I am forced to permanently uninstall as it has become unplayable for me.",0
"my graphics for this game are set to very low and the frame rate is still a bit poop, ",0
"when you start each hospital, it is fun for about 20 minutes but then the game goes from intermediate to very very hard very quickly as you become overloaded with incurable dying patients, debt that never seems to go away, and everyone wanting to get promoted at the same time",0

"if I do get in the red, it does not take long to start building back up and once you do then you build up fast. ",0
"I participated in the game's ""main"" storyline. It's one of those 'pick your bad ending' plots which isn't really worth putting a spoiler alert on. It really is that forgettable.",0
Hands down the game is really really good although I would really love to see more choices/options for customization to weapons and outfits (things to make your operator stand out) ,0
Some screen on text has such bad contrast and disappears too quickly. Low visibility and useless torch that just faces behind you sometimes or turns off randomly meant I fell down into a cave that seemed to only have the one opening in the ceiling.,0

When has a game is own profanity filter been beat by itself?,0
"Local chat is bad, and it should simply be removed altogether.",0
 there has been a difficulty spike.,0
The crafting system is very unclear and gives little enough guidance to only annoy you. There are just too many innovative solutions that are never explained to the player. Who came up with this save game system that you have to google to understand? ,0
"Other than that, the game lives up to what it was marketed to be.

I'm honestly surprised it’s not more popular as a streaming game but that is also whats probably keeping it as entertaining as it is.,1
"This game is a spiritual successor to theme park hospital world, it was a game made by brofrog back in 1973 for the commadore master system 52, it was considered the greatest game ever made, so good in fact that no one in the history of video games, which goes back a long way, (1918 was the first recorded video game that is a fact) has ever tried to recreate it.",1

"in addition, the developers made the game as a platform to sell dlcs through. they have tried hard to make the game relevant through in-game events. this is pretty blatant and might look like they are trying to sell the game piecemeal, however the game does have a lot of base content and is time consuming to play (if only because of grinding) and a few items (albeit thematically wrong otherwise) has been released for free over the years.",1
" ""If this game had SC's flight simulation characteristics IT would be the best damn space sim ever!"" Alas while both of these game scratch the itch of Galactic exploration, survival and progression the flight characteristics of NMS are like Pong (for those old enough to know what I'm talking about) compared to SC being a detailed X-Plane commercial airline flight simulation run.

This product clearly says k-cups & the product is not that! It came as bags to brew a pitcher. I do not want these I want k-cups.",0
"Too hard to close and not lightweight

This umbrella is really hard to close because the spring is too tight. I have to push it against the wall to close it. It’s also heavier than my other two umbrellas that I’ve had for years... too bad...",0
"Inconsistent sizing

Length is perfect but the sizing is so inconsistent! I bought two pairs to try on, 26, and 27. But the 27 is tighter than 26! And it’s literally an inch smaller...",0

Product was not what I had hoped for. Was flimsy and the suction cup doesn't hold well. Seemed cheaply made.",0

I ordered it because I liked the model, I received a round regular ashtray",0

Kind of disappointed !!",0

This is the 3rd time I've order this in two weeks. All 3 times they have sent steel bed rail brackets . The package has a label for the brackets but another label for the picture hooks pasted over it. The seller should get wise and contact Amazon or he will lose a lot of business. Also, it costs someone the return postage every time. I may have to order 50 or more of these before they wake up. I have told them twice already.",0

Goggles were well constructed but had a terrible glare on the inside of the lens making it extremely difficult to see underwater",0
"So so

Not very satisfied with this product",1
"I liked it

Interesting story and semi-detailed descriptions of sweat lodge experiences. The lack of a revenge motive was refreshing. It did seem to be a little juvenile in places but overall an entertaining read.",1
"Not for sensitive skin

Would be ok if my skin wasn’t so sensitive",1
"Nice look to tight for women

I have small head and did not sit well, I used it because it was for custom and did not have time to change.",1
"Cute, but multiple bags needed.

The colors were cute and girly. Perfect for our 1 year old daughter. The balls are not very sturdy. She is able to squeeze them, I make sure not to crush them if I get in the pit with her. 1 bag is definitely not enough. We bought 3 bags of 200 balls and maybe could have even gotten away with one more.",1
"Wrong color

We ordered the pink shirt but it was not the color that was on the listing. We needed a baby pink color for a dance performance and it came as more of a dark pink color. The style and fit were great but we had to return it because it was the wrong color.",1
"Copper Plated

These hooks are only copper plated.",1

"Three Stars

WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS WESTERN.",1
"Three Stars

It does not fit in the ear well. That makes the product usability. Thanks",1
"easy and efficient

a friend of mine recommended I buy a food saver since I live alone and often have left overs. I used for the first time to package individual chicken breasts it was so user friendly and worked with out a hitch. After using it for a few times it does not suck and seal as well as it once did. I plan on calling the manufacturer soon to see if maybe it is defective. Overall, I would still buy it!",1
"Super cute pattern

I love the pattern but the material on the rugs are pretty thin and get dirty pretty quick, I am scared to wash them for fear the pattern will fade or completely come off. They are really cute to look at though.",1
"This product smells bad

This product smells musty. It is an almost unbearable stench. It has made my Switch smell. So disappointed...Wouldn't buy this one",1
"looks good. works ok

looks good.. but drips.. I don't know if it's the way it's built or what but it is irritating...",1
"Surprised that it has holes in top cover

I bought this to use in an open 14' boat with a 25HP Honda outboard. The two areas where the cables can go in when the top is tightly fastened with the strap should provide adequate ventilation, but there are two dime-sized grids that are directly open to the rain and/or spray from boating, which eventually would fill and flood the battery box. Not sure why this is designed thus, will just have to check it frequently.",1
"So small

These are soooooo small. Not even sure what size I could order just to cover my bum. Sucks because they are very well made. Order up 2 or so sizes.",1
"Battery conductor

The battery conduction point is lose and it has to be really fiddled with to make the little vacuum to work. It doesn't really pick up staples, which is what I really wanted it for. Does an alright job on dust.",1
"3/5

I thought it was okay. Really wanted to see an end fight scene. Hated that they skipped it. Lazy director?",1
"Cute, but not practical

This is the cutest bird feeder I own. However, I'm not sure what it is good for. Most sunflower seeds slip right through the mesh, so most fall on the ground. I suppose you could rig up something that would hang under it so that what spills out would be caught. Of course, there are many birds that will find the spillage on the ground and consume it, so all is not lost. It seems to be well made and since I love ladybug beetles, I find it charming. You can spot it across the yard.",1
"I got this and it worked great for the first 2 months

I got this and it worked great for the first 2 months. Now, if my dog cries even slightly it goes off. If another dog barks, it goes off. Great product when working correctly.",1
"Cute but not very durable.

Not for an active kid. My son had these for less than 2 months and already made holes. Literally can’t wear them in the rain. To be fair, he drags his feet in the cement while riding his toddler car. The bad part was that it didn’t take too long for the holes to show up. Not even a couple days of his rough play and he had made holes in them. They are very well made and super cute. Just not for a kid who’s always playing and dragging around. He’s just 3 y/o and very active.",1
"Not bad

These only lasted one day at my house. Probably from the kids jumping on them but they worked fine. I will try the old school ones next.",1
"they looks very poor

After few washes, they looks very poor",1
"Difficult to read

Just a note to others. The LCD background is black so the numbers do not have a strong contrast making this (me) difficult to read day or night at a glance. Otherwise would have given 4 stars overall. I returned mine...thank you Amazon.",1
"Pay someone to tint your sidelights.

Very hard to apply. Gave us a run for our money to try to adhere to sidelight windows. Was a pain in the tail.",1
"A little short for my liking

I ordered this in navy, and the color is as pretty as I expected. It is made of a lightweight, stretchy material, so it fits a little snuggly around the chest and arms. I like the way it flares out without looking like a maternity dress. However, it is a little too short for my liking. It is just at my fingertips when my arms are down at my sides. I almost sent it back for this reason, but decided to just wear it with thicker leggings. It will look nice with a scarf or a long pendant necklace.",1
"Has to be plugged in to put your phone in it.

I have followed all your books and have e enjoyed reading them. I'm looking forward to seeing this series continue and waiting for your new series.",1
"Satisfying taste but not strong enough to help with sleeplessness. 😢

The taste is great but I didn’t feel that it caused any sleepiness or deeper sleep. I don’t want to increase the dosage due to the sweet content.",1
"Just ok

Where is the adhesive on these sliders??. We used them but think they could have been made better.",1
"Damaged Fire pit and missing parts

I really like the look of this product and the price but unfortunately I have not had a chance to use it yet. The box came with damaged parts and missing screws. I reached out to the company and they responded very quickly and I'm now waiting for the new parts. We were really looking forward to using this before it got too cold, I guess that will not happen. Once I receive everything and the fire pit is working I will update my review.",1

Planted them none of them came up",1
"Didn’t work for me :-(

The product came in a closed package well wrapped. I have one of these on bedroom tv (Hisense) and it works perfect. My office t. (Toshiba) is a different story. The USB port does not deliver enough power to replace the factory cord. Hope that it works for you because it’s a great idea.",1
"Baseball tshirts

They look small for a men's medium. Will know after Christmas if they need to be returned.",1
"Damaged

I can't really fairly review this product as it was damaged when I received it and I could not assemble it due to a bent component. Doesn't look like it happened in shipping. Returned it for refund and went to local Medical supply store.",1
"Comfortable and Cute

T-shirt feel, but comfortable and light. Perfect when it is humid and looking for soft and breathable comfort.",1
"Straps are way to close

Straps are too short even with extending them. The top of the straps are too close to center so they end up rubbing against your neck. The size and bright red color are great. The plastic is very thick which is good so won't tear easily",1
"Battery use

We loved them, but the batteries only lasted about a week and then needed replaced. With over 10 of these, it was going to be expensive replacing the batteries each week or two.",1
"It's ok

Not very sudsy. Weird consistency",1
"Not a big boost, not sure it's worth it.

I get three bars of Verizon at home. This was quick and easy to install. But......it boosted me all the way from three to a whopping FOUR bars. Not sure that was worth two hundred bucks.",1
"Colors not bright

Nice pencils but didn't like the colors they are neither pastels or neons. And colors rather dull",1
"Great for filling muscles.

This product is terrific for rolling your muscles. However there are much better options for trigger point therapy. The straight stick and knobs are not practical for typical trigger point therapy.",1
"Dose the work, but too overpriced

Should have been only couple dollars so... hope it will hold log enough to compensate for the price paid.",1
"Three Stars

Don't fit my big nostrils and very uncomfortable",1
"Fun game for the most part

Bought this as a present and I have one my self for my ps4. It’s a fun game but get ready for a massive head ache It is a lot of fun to play and What not but if you do use the headphones like I like to do to get more real life experience, play get ready to get a headache because the game is pretty scary",1
"Inaccurate range

Definitely does not have a 150 miles range. Maybe 50 miles at best.",1
"Good on a budget

I wanted to love this mouse I have been very pleased with redragon mice in the past this one sadly falls short of even my logi g502. The second row of buttons are very weak in this they feel worn out and it is new, I am expecting the others to feel the same very soon, the plastic is not like their previous product it feels very cheep in hand, the mode selector is on the bottom so quick access is not there with no way to validate other than opening the software to see what mode your in, finally even though the extra step feels good on the fingers it makes the base so wide if there is any uneven part of your desk it will teeter todder and miss inputs. For the price it is a good piece to test but I would recommend from my expirence paying 20$ more for another brand. Positives it does feel nice in hand even with the cheap plastic, the software is surprising doing well, easy to use and gives you multiple options such as double keying, lastly even though the side buttons need some love to input there are enough buttons to make anyone happy.",1
"A fair read

Fair attempt at telling a story worth telling. I like the introduction of a plausible suspect. Useful information about the nature of policing in the time. Patching writing in places but decent conversational tone throughout. Hard to keep track of all the killings but fair attempt to do that for the reader.",1
"Awkward

Although it is a very cute dress the fit is awkward. I did return it because there was no fixing the way it bulged feom the armpit area to my breast. The semi petticoat was very itchy as well, but fine with a slip. The fabric however was comfy on the skin and had a small amount of stretch.",1

"Issues

The end popped off this hose. I’ve never had that happen before. Screwed an adjustable head on and when I turned on the water, pop goes the brass head. Could be a fun game to scare the crap out of someone, which is why I gave it three stars, otherwise would’ve given this a one star.",1
"Weak tea, no aroma.

Based on reviews, I decided to try out this Yorkshire blend of black teas. Turned out quite weak after 5 minutes of brewing; with no distinctive flavor or aroma. It was only 3.99 for 100, so its no big loss. We also use tea bags to add color to some curry dishes, and it certainly fits that function.",1
"Three Stars

It's ok - The fabric is not so stretchable for yoga/stretching workouts though.",1
"Better options than these

My dog loves these but they don’t love her. They make her reflux, upset her stomach and aren’t organic. Even a minute amount causes lip-licking, yawning and other signs of gastric distress. Tossed the remainder, will never buy again.",1
"Feels pretty good for plantar fascia pain.

Definitely not the magical solution. They are nice because they do not move around much in your shoe and do provide some support and stimulation to the foot. I did think they would be a little more firm so that was disappointing. Overall not bad but I prefer some of longer (3/4 length of your foot) and more stable inserts out there. If the only problem you have is pain in the heel, rather than elsewhere in the foot, these are worth a try and are not overly expensive.",1
"Great to keep you cool

Vacation must have if going to a warm location and you will be out walking in the heat!",2

Takes alot of the mess out of greasing fittings. Positive locking works perfect. I Definatly recommend this. Not great in tight places though",2

Outside plastics look cheaply made",2
"Pillow case that give you better skin and less hair breakage? Yes, Please!!

I love, love, love this pillow case. I have had it for a few months now and it has held up beautifully. I bought a silk pillow with the intention of the promised improvement to my skin and hair. Though, it hasn’t been a miracle cure for hair breakage, I have noticed an improvement in my skin and hair. It also features a zipper closure, which keeps the pillow case from slipping off. The only set back is that you have to take special care when washing, but it is definitely worth it. I also get extremely hot when I sleep and this pillow case has made sleeping much cooler.",2
"This is a great feature.

I tested with items that I have weights for, and the scale was right each time. I did have to play around a bit to zero out after placing a bowl on the scale. This is a great feature..",2
"Its ok

This sits on a stand I picked it up by the stand and the stand broke",2
"So much fun!

Love this author. Book is an easy but fun read. Make sure you read the entire trilogy.",2
"Great headphone stand

I use this to hold my headphones when I’m not wearing them, and it’s also an interesting conversation piece.",2
"Well made and true to color but does not stand up

This is the perfect size and made very well. It just takes a long time to actually hold a shape after unpacking. It does not stand up as shown which is to be expected with it being packed for shipped. It’s very thick and durable and true to color.",2
"It is confortable

I love it, it is confortable and easy used",2
"Fits perfectly

I love my hat. It seems to be of great quality and it looks really cute.",2
"Super thick and Super Versatile

This wig comes nicely packaged with a wig cap and is super thick; which is crazy considering the price. Such a great deal since it can easily be styled for just about any Harley look.",2
"Great Tongs!

These tongs are amazing! They have a great feel to them and are extremely sturdy! The silicon tips are easy to clean and hold up to high heat with no melting whatsoever. These tongs have a nice weight to them so they are not going to bend when picking up heavier things, such as a heavy pieces of meat. I like that they close and open by pulling/pushing the tab on the end of them. These are well made sturdy tongs and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a nice sturdy well built set of tongs!",2

5 stars if you put what it is for on the plan when you send it",2

Really like this case. Fits perfect and seems to be of good quality. Perfect for protection whilst still looking clean and classic. Great case.",2
"In a good way.

Fit as expected. Unexpectedly heavy. In a good way.",2
"Adorable!

Very neat for my First Graders but a little hard to use. They don't mind because this stuff is so popular right now. I use it in my spelling center so they can practice using their spelling words and they have had a blast. Gave 4 stars due to a few spots that have a flaw and it's a little hard to flip on one part of it, where the flaws are, but they love it anyway.",2
"Purple is much better in person than pictured

I'm very happy with this bag. I was hesitant to purchase because the purple in the product picture is very saturated, but I gave it a shot based on the review photos. The purple is perfect, much better in person. The bag is small but it holds the cases for my .40 and 380, plus plenty of boxes of ammo. There's a divider in the middle compartment that keeps the ammo boxes in place. There are 4 pockets around the outside that are spacious, and there's plenty of room in one pocket to hide my extra necessities. The bag is well made and I'd highly recommend it to any person looking for color instead of a basic black bag.",2
"A bit small.

Works fine, but the size: A biggish salad for one or 2 small side salads. Really a bit too small for two, whereas the regular size version is a bit too big. I am goldilocks and I can't find a salad spinner sized to suit...",2
"Almost Perfect.

Great! Blu Ray came in good condition. Although I prefer the cardboard packaging like a couple years ago.",2
"Decent

I believe it did work a little but the tablets are hard to intake.",2
"Smells very good. My second time purchasing this cologne

Smells very good. My second time purchasing this cologne. Obviously just expensive as you are paying for the name Versace.",2
"Quality power.

The switch mechanism is well designed. Comfortable to hold & operate for longer grinds & cuts. A bit of a process to remove the guard when necessary.",2
"Enjoyable

Enjoyable read will more than likely purchase other books by this author.",2
"Good build quality, a bit unwieldy

The material and construction of it is top notch, just a bit large and awkward to grasp and use for a man with fairly short hair to use.",2
"Excellent Value

Really soft and not too heavy. My only criticism is that I would have liked it to be a bit wider. It's probably fine if you just have one person in the bed, but once you get 2 bodies underneath it there's not a lot of extra comforter on the sides. But it's very durable. I bought this as a quickie replacement after a cat puke incident with my old comforter and I'm happy with the purchase.",2
"Five Stars

loved it. Reasonable price with quality.",2
"I think it works.

I take it to help with my cholesterol levels. Seems to be helping.",2

Caused me to break out a bit whenever I would take this. Great product though",2
"Different hair styles

I ordered these for my 3 year old niece and my sister has learned a lot of different hair styles.",2
"pretty to wear once in awhile

It is pretty, however, I only gave it a 4 star because, of the sizeing. This ring runs one whole size off. If you wear a size 6 then by all means order a size 7. It does not look like diamonds maybe because, it is not diamonds but, as for costume jewelry it is nice. Will it turn at some point? Probably but, check the price you get what you pay for. All in all not a bad ring.",2
"Resulting smell of the bag not pleasant

Took away the dog smell, but the resulting smell from the bag is not particularly pleasant. I expected no smell when I used the product.",2

This wig is by far the best wig ive gotten that was curly ... The hair is pretty an very soft ... Doesnt tangle or mat up very little shedding no smell to nothing .... The issue I had was they did send a 16inch like I requested. They sent me a 10 inch curly maybe 12 inch ... It took to bleach and coloring very well OVER all the wig is a great wig if you like THAT curly hair .... I would buy this hair again",2
