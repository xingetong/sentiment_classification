"I really want to like No Man's Sky, but every time they push an update I get a fleeting moment of excitement until I quickly learn they fail to deliver on the basics, ",0
only complaint have is the randomness of the symbols and items once had run with tombs and urns but without anything that can destroy them or that synergies with spirits wish symbols and items would be either automatically rigged little towards your synergies could be rigged by the player with luck statistic that other None can increase synergy capsule or different type of rare currency with which you could even possibly choose the symbol you want the next symbols to synergize with,0
"What I have realized through thinking more about this game is that it is not necessarily bad, but extremely bland. The story is uninspired and shallow.",0
"Planets feels repetitive, having jumping from two or five for a newcomer feels really great, but when you spend more time and the planets number goes up, its get boring real fast. .I mean, ",0
"Even the starting ship, with basic gear, can handle most space threats, including battling several pirates or a full sentinel threat, with relative ease.",0
The introduction is painfully terrible and dumps so much info on me that I absorb none of it and I only progress because the game tells me exactly what to do.,0
"Some things are way TOO LOUD and others TOO quiet. The overhead non-stop ships and over-the-top storms are deafening. The game desperately in need of ""Private Air Space Area"" function to prevent this.",0
 the colour schemes for stars and economies are not disability friendly,0

two point hospital is a shallow room spam to cope with the ever-increasing hordes of patients,0
 but it is frustrating that in VR my 1080ti ,0
"Game felt too restrictive for my taste, also controls like fov is surprisingly restrictive and you can't seem to change first person fov, kinda disappointed I can't crash my ship into a planet.",0
don’t care if this is server sided or player sided because people got CR/-\PPY internet connections but even with my 500/500Mbit Fiber connection people are just one big pile of pixel laggers!,0
"This game may be full of bugs, ",0
"I play multiplayer with a SINGLE other person and despite how far this game has come in the way of updates (which has been mostly great), the game still crashes unexpectedly especially when going to the options menu for some reason and I",0
there was very little challenge.,0
The AI can do a full rotation in 0.1 seconds and shoot you down with 100% accuracy and ,0
 but the finer textures tend to pop or straight up use the lowest res version in some cases (usually npc faces),0
"Night vision is not correctly modelled (no peripheral vision) and is a tad too bright in some places, just perfect in others so it becomes impractical to bring on missions where there is a lot of darkness but a light in the house is on.",0
"you cannot get 100% achievements (as of 2-19-2020), due to needing friends to do parts of your superbug initiatives, in their own hospital. tips: it is indeed a balancing act between having the right amount of general practitioners’ offices, diagnosis rooms and treatment rooms.",0
"CONS: The game is, for the most part, almost completely silent with little music. ",0
"When I reviewed it first, I said I really really liked it but gave a negative review cause of the lies.",0
"Very hard to do some micromanagement tasks you are familiar with from other games, limiting staff to one activity is done on a staff-by-staff level with numerous clicks.",0
The tactical FPS genre seriously needed its standards raised.,0
An excellent tactical shooter that ,0
"maybe I do not know the hotkeys/easier ways to do it, but queue management could be better (when you want to choose a bunch of people to kick out of the hospital). a button to kick or send to treatment while looking at the queue list would be great.",0
"The audio is repetitive, same sounds and music’s over and over, and adds nothing to the gameplay.",0
"within the main campaign, barely any combat and it hardly incentivises adventure.",0
lack of a voice tutorial poor and not a great intro to the game.,0
 but I am unable to continue playing it because the crashing issue I do not want to refund the game but feel might as well due to not being able to play it.so keep this in mind if your going to buy this game as you might not get to go past the first hospital :(,0
and they do not come close to those used in theme hospital.,0
"Every star system is the same - 2-5 (single biome) planets with no real diversity or relation to one another, ",0
"This game is an inch-deep ocean with nothing visible on the horizon, a silent and monotonous waste of your precious time.",0
"no difficulty settings, very confusing and not user-friendly customization options, no explanations of anything, I can keep going.",0
the tutorial did not explain a lot of features so that was very confusing.,0
single player mode needs something better than the old system form swat4 almost 20 ¥ years ago.,0
 isn’t blowing my hair back with graphics or AI interaction and voice lines.,0
"It's frustrating not being able to hit anything because there's no rollback. I have to predict and lead every shot I take, and it's near impossible in maps full of cover. I'd essentially only be able to push in with the shield while he shoots for me.",0
"If you managed to survive not getting shot by a random enemy AI that spotted you through a miniscule gap in a wall, well done, ",0
"everything way more likely to spontaneously break, and you'll probably soon wind up in parallel realities",0
there is no real risk-reward.- this also goes for staff challenges.,0
" its only tutorial is a store page video (no tooltips, no guiding voice, no handholding) ",0
"I have never encountered so many issues with a game before, ",0
 since there are no public servers.,0
" you can buy Arma 3 AND its DLCs, create a Swat operation using mods available on the workshop that'll be better optimized than the current state of this game.",0
Save yourself the money and go buy something more worth your time such as Battlefield 2042.,0
after 4 hours,0
"Please, please add a photosensitivity option disabling the white flashes, or at a minimum enable the shaders responsible for these flashes to be modded by the phenomenal modding community.",0
 the reviews are far too kind as is.,0
"just as annoying.it has the announcements, the earthquakes, the silly (new) disease names and descriptions. ",0
there is no option to auto send-off patients that you do not have the room to treat. ,0
"i have found that the main complaint, pathfinding, can almost always be attributed to poor design/placement of walls/items. by realizing that people form a line at many places, example - reception, and if that line backs into any other line, example - vending machines, or object, examples - radiators/plants, they bug out. this is especially a problem in wards as where you put screens or plaster casters drastically impact how people move through the room.",0
"now you gotta scroll to see ur stuff. it’s not game breaking you might think, but then some tech you had installed suddenly disappeared or was deleted becuz of the inventory change.",0
 Ethan Gach is a pot stirring brainless poster.,0
" about 1/4 of the games I play I find that my teammates are muted when they speak, though they can still hear me.",0
it is too much waiting in this game. and what you have to do is done quickly and then you have to wait for a long time again before you can do some more in the game.,0
"This game does not respect your time, your actions have no impact, , the game is boring and trivially challenging after only a few hours.",0
And my friend got motion sickness and I wholeheartedly blame the game for this.,0
so it would be helpful to add a difficulty setting.,0
need more keybinding/camera control options for the mouse,0
" done all the modes but it’s a weird feeling, you know this game can be, NO should be so much more and it isn’t, it’s a shallow, vain creature that demands your attention, but rewards you with promises and not the satisfaction achievements or advancement of a narrative.",0
"Exceeded my expectations for a new game,  and not a lot of maps",0
this game needs 2 years of development and another year of beta testing to be good.,0
I was stuck in the loading screen back-to-back from my friend invite and lobby.,0
"Last the only thing I'm not happy with the AI seems so strong I l know a powerful AI maybe bring fun to this game, but I have never seen a AI such powerful, the T without out protection can kill the CT easily. I think it break the balance of the game .",0
It's tiresome to navigate the entire map looking for someone you forgot to report or a small thing you missed.,0
Refunded the game. Even free to play games have a SETTING button.,0
"And when something is being built in the settlement, I have to provide resources, so I have to go here and there and collect the resources, so that one hour later I can do the same thing and one hour later I can do the same thing, and so on. ",0
(no difficulty setting btw).,0
". I often had to sit and pause the game while I sorted through patients, set up new rooms, etc. it is hard to do it while the game is playing because you will get inundated with choices and not really have a way out. I restarted several hospitals, trying to take into account what I learned in the previous round, but it really does not make a difference.",0
raids or some random events that require a lot of players saving a planet or something like that,0
"It just feels too rigid currently. Someone charges you, and you put two rounds of beanbag in their chest at medium range, following it up with a close range kneecap, should NOT kill them. They need to introduce the ""Incapacitated suspect/Civillian"", as at least that was a good middle ground if you didn't just twitch and blow someone’s head off, you could save your final score a bit by just kneecapping the bastards.",0
"So you're often going to feel bored or lonely whilst playing the game. Play this game in a voice call with friends, or watching something in the background to fill the dead air.",0
"keeps on crushing on startup on ubuntu 18.04 ... I am not even able to pass the ""sega"" launch screen",0
"Wish there were some more interesting gadgets to use, maybe some movement tools (scaling elevators or walls would be 10/10 amazing, adding verticality would bring some much-needed map variety), ",0
"Lack of realism is really noticeable, or ",0
 but I had to spend hours finishing up the rest of the game I never got to because of the repetitiveness.  that would allow players to go in and fix already built but broken or run down hospitals.,0
hopefully not at the cost of IRL currency. Maybe some in game currency and a way to earn it would be cool? along with a shop?,0
and lack of optimization tasks,0
"this is a good game with fun content. however, it is far too expensive. the regional pricing that exists on this game is utterly discriminatory. when the game can be had for a 1/6th of the price if you live somewhere else, it is patently unfair. ",0
because my computer is too old.,0
"There's no gravity, except when your boots are actually on the ground. You don't orbit a planet. You don't need to think about your path through a solar system.",0
"while it is far too simplified to be considered a simulator, ",0
 this is pretty unrealistic and entirely unchallenging.,0
this would be more fun if the navigation and placing items were easier.,0
"Edit: multiplayer with 0 cooperation, its basically playing single player while seeing each other.",0
As a left handed I can't play this game the way I do with every other games. . .,0
the game does not give you clear explanation to certain things such as inspection or report.,0
"have only encountered one glitch so far where a patient got ""stuck"" on a building, and no matter how I moved things away from him he would not unstick. after nearly three years in my hospital he is still standing there complaining.",0
" stories with intrigue, character development and suspense.",0
"The gameplay loop reaches its end stage quick,",0
"Some mission prompts give you bad information that will send you on wild goose chases - for example there's a mission that tells you to ask lifeforms ""on your planet"" for information, so you'll run all over your planet looking for answers, until you find an obscure line in the mission log contradicting ALL other instructions and telling you to leave the planet and go to a space station. ",0
"I normally use Nexus, but I really enjoy how streamline mods are when Devs incorporate Workshop support. I cannot recommend Mod IO. I've never dealt with it before, but with the current issues you cannot run your game if you have mods from Mod IO.",0
"after all this years no real multiplay/cooplet me explain, its just an shared area for you and your friends but many parts are not in syncyou can fight enemies, see natural events or other npcs BUT your friends can't see them or interact with them, THEY see their own stuff.",0
"feels completely pointless. Sure, there is something of a story but all it seems your doing is flying from one place to another endlessly.",0
"The menus drift around, the galaxy map is just awful to interact with,, the in-game guide has key words highlighted in arbitrary colours that don't provide any additional information, the different economies are represented by names/symbols/colours that are not ever shown  together, etc etc etc.",0
I have followed step by step guides and YouTube video is click by click... failed. ,0
the game started feeling like a grind.,0
"The tutorial is so overly complicated, lengthy, and glitchy, that I am on my 3rd run of the game, because the last 2 tutorials soft blocked me. ",0
The option just pops up whenever it wants.,0
 I have a specific place to keep my game screenless and it's weird when it's not all together.,0
 it will run from buttery smooth to hard freezing and stuttering and always in the worst moments.,0
"Enjoyed the gameplay, unfortunately the brightness settings and then flashlights conflicted too much. Would go from impossible to see anything because it's too dark to impossible to see anything because it's too bright.  ",0
only dislike is I suck on keyboard. I play on xbox remote.,0
are super hard to kill even with light armor not like you with your super heavy armor dying to a knife stab.,0
"But sadly I just felt like refunding it,",0
the game play loop in my honest opinion is not enjoyable. Now I will say I did not play this game extensively only about an hour and a half but in that hour and half I felt pretty solid in my decision to refund it before the two hour time limit.,0
 I do love that the game will get more content in the future I wish there was official controller support for the game here is an update for 2022the game has received  massive updates over the course of 2022 there are now more weapons gadgets attachments. ,0
I might like this game if you did not need to play through the campaign to unlock sandbox mode which is just a pain,0
I dislike how when I click find session to play with strangers it kicks me back to main menu and tells me I lost connection to the server host.,0
some could argue it is not high on difficulty though virtual reality paradise players might be exaggerating about all the negatives. difficulty is not high ,0
and on top you are using gender language? you gotta be kidding! Won´t get a single cent from me!,0
high learning curve gameplay.,0
"I would really appreciate filters in video settings. I use Geforce experience to turn it B&W, add some grain and letterbox.. . I think if they added that touch along with other filters it would be an amazing experience. I would ideally like a B&W experience with red blood.",0
"It would be nice if there was a little more depth in the procedural content, but I have not even left the star system I started in yet, so who knows what is out there.",0
"I will say that on lower end PCs,",0
turn off PVP in settings because there will be groups of people picking on you if you don't.,0
I give it an F for no filter or for the word you here more than any other word,0
You can't do the campaign with other players/friends ,0
"once you start a school year you essentially just sit around and twiddle your thumbs, unless some kind of emergency occurs.",0
Turkish language support please ):,0
"Planets could have more diverse features, such as rivers, maybe planets overridden by AI, planets with tons of life and no colonies/trade posts etc. Smaller planets should have less gravity.",0
Enemies would spawn in and I couldn’t see them or they couldn’t see my enemies. There would be invisible worms and invisible flying enemies. My world would have a storm and I would have to run back to find cover but my friends next to me would have nothing. Then I would come back to join them after my storm was gone and they would be getting a storm. ,0
" the incentives to explore are basically inexistent, ship crafting is non-existent also.",0
every time I do a photo missionit crash but only for those photo missions.,0
So I bought the supporter edition.,0
my rig is old now and was only mid ranged when I built it 6 years ago. ,0
So lazy to not incorporate full controller support so it can be played on steam deck. ,0
It's been out for almost five years and it's still buggier than an early access game.,0
", but you always die and lose everything you have. ",0
* freezing and hitching every time a player enters or exits the current planetary system,0
there is no good reason for me to be getting a steady 11-20 fps on this game with that equipment.,0
My biggest criticism so far is a lack of simplifying options in the inventory menu's interface (making you have to drag and drop to stacks of similar things in other inventories).,0
On most maps I have to have my resolution and all graphics settings all the way down and the game still stutters and lags.,0
"as of right now, the game feels unrefined and far too automated.",0
 the game released in a terrible state.,0
"There are myriad ways the game could be improved like: - Make the procedural landscapes feel less procedural. Maybe there is a way to use actual aerial imagery from Earth, Mars, and the Moon in a machine learning environment to truly create a believable randomized natural landscape.",0
"I know this might sound dumb to 99% of the player base here, but I am mute and playing with anyone in coop is a nightmare for me for the most part, having to make my own Auto Hotkey script for commands and simple replies just to not stop and type for a second as I need that time. SWAT 4 had a system where you could easily talk to your team as lead and as a team member with the command menu, I really hope they add that into Ready Or Not or else this review will change to a No.",0
" The Single Player mode lacks, this is meant to be played with other players.",0
 there is still no left-handed support,0
you don't get rewarded for killing other players and the mechanics are currently not made for pvp obviously.,0
"The game is significantly incomplete and will never truly be a tactical shooter until the protective gear the player gives themselves and their team will actually protect them from the threats they face, the player is given ample opportunity and resource to analyze the location, plan and memorize their movements and strategies, and effectively execute said movements and strategies.",0
"I first noticed this in one of the earlier levels, where an actor stood for years wondering how to get to a marketing campaign video shoot. but more annoyingly, bands who turn up to the student union quite randomly are unable to find their way to the union. at one stage I had a gaggle of 15 musicians waiting on the campus, none of whom would move (even when I put a fountain on top of them ;-)).",0
my only real criticism is that the map screen at the beginning lags like it has gone out of fashion but after playing for a bit I would completely forget about this.,0
especially after bug fixes and DLCs that give you problems after developers have altered game.. MOTO is....if it’s not broke don't try to fix it...,0
"it is a bit too easy, thus far; unlike the first original theme hospital, it looks like failing is not really something that is going to happen a lot, the difficulty does not seem to ramp up.",0
"staff will get stuck in weird travel loops,",0
the number of glitches that I encountered are way more than I would hope from a game that's been out this long.,0
" the vibration from first person view makes me feel really sick, and this is why I don't play it that much anymore.",0
you'll often have to switch to single player to be able to do missions.,0
"also, when in build mode for a room, it would be nice if the fore-facing wall disappeared as it would make it easier for object placement.",0
"meaning when you start more advanced hospitals, you will get constantly messages to validate manually to decide between keeping a patient in the hospital (and probably having him die here with no treatment) or send him home.",0
" I have quite the game with saving my progress and started it again. everything was once again smooth. however, the nasty surprise came when I attempted to continue my saved progress. as I was welcomed by basically a message “your save is corrupted, cannot be loaded, we are sorry.” which I am sorry as well.",0
its not working on mac,0
"no, I do not like this game, it was funny at the beginning the idea about building my own hospital, but there are things I do not like it",0
"only that I am locked in perpetual combat with sentinels and pirates and god knows what else everywhere I go, on foot, in a ship, everywhere I travel is non-stop, constant mind-numbingly tedious spin-in-circles hold-down-LMB combat.",0
"I am chewing through the game pretty quickly, and",0
"Speaking of the species (Korvax, Vy'Keen, Gek), learning their languages are so extremely boring. Not only is there no use other than a bit of flavor when you talk to npcs (because it literally tells you what they mean),",0
only recommend buying it on sale!!,0
"I turned off the online function and STILL, OTHER RANDOM PLAYERS I DON'T KNOW KEEPS ENTERING MY GAME, AND CLAIM MY DISCOVERIES.",0
"but no option/support/inclusion of subtitles at all. as a hard of hearing person, this makes it impossible for me to play this game.",0
"did not expect much out of this time management game (I rarely ever do),",0
"I have only played one mission with mouse and keyboard and the rest of the time with an Xbox one controller. The game does not have controller support,",0
they haven’t even started working on controller support ,0
"But I can't play it anymore: the full-screen white flashes during transitory actions (engaging/disengaging pulse engine, finish loading the game, etc. ) turn my eyes into soup and give me migraines within 40 minutes. ",0
barely every student is black or beige rarely white students what is this??,0
"240 second reaction time I can easily defeat the three man squad with mirrors and shields by shooting through door jams, and no I am not sure why I can fire every bullet in rapid secession like ever gun has an automatic mode.",0
"There are some weird decisions on the controls, like gamepads use the left stick click for the scanner and right stick click for sprint, you press the left stick forward to accelerate, and use the right stick to steer instead of using the triggers as throttle and brake.",0
The Enemies and the civilians can be superposed over each other ,0
fun at start but repetitive somewhat mobile game x SimCity without paying. it’s getting boring after levels and yea there’s funny but repetitive bores me overtime. ,0
"i at first wanted to say I liked this game but as you get further in the game it becomes impossible the people do not move efficiently, and",0
The only downside of the body camera system in my opinion is that it slightly lowers your FPS.,0
"It is a bit buggy still in multi-player mode, ",0
I tried committing heinous crimes and fighting off the space-police and I even gave the slightly-awful space combat a good shot. ,0
"tried playing, it and it really feels archaic, simple things like navigating around are slow and cumbersome.",0
"Most of all, the game turns into a grind toward the end of the level searching for remaining civilians usually well after all threats are neutralized.",0
"but with some cracks that needs fixing, ",0
but it is not good because there is no Korean language support.,0
The game is clearly designed for controller and feels pretty awkward with mouse and keyboard.,0
I had attempted to play it on Xbox Live for PC a couple of years ago but ,0
"where the difficulty comes from the entire team getting screwed by one lobotomized teammate saying hi to the local sleepers or the casual check that just slams you after the first 2 or so games, but rather having to strategize with somewhat limited resources and firefights that can end very quickly going both ways, ",0
"Base building has the same issue where you will build a beautiful base, , a. k. a building in minecraft effect. ",0
My only gripe is that I can't choose my own file path for my photos to go into.,0
Profanity filter ruins immersion ,0
the usual darkness that makes rusty lake a light horror series was replaced by... really just a sort of depressed feeling.,0
"it is annoying that it does not have workshop/mod support, but that is my only complaint.",0
144 fps performance isn't great ,0
"A basic tutorial guide is really needed, when enter lobby section (also the training/briefing place) of the game, you will not know what to do & where to go, or, when you customise your guns, attachments are not there, you have run around to find the quartermaster to take attachments, really confused, because the game don't have basic guides.",0
"storage space is an absolute f*cking nightmare until you've been to that hub, after I bought some blueprints at that hub, I was happy I ran out of nanites because the main questline pretty much ended up giving me a blueprint I didn't have the nanites to buy, which was a storage container, which needs power€¦.",0
"would recommend but wait for it to be on sale, I got a free weekend so I could try before I buy I will wait on it to be around the $15 mark before I consider buying it.",0
"As for the ""profanity"" filter you cannot even say Got, Gotten or Closer, as well as many other non-swear words...",0
 I tried hard and long to dig deeper and deeper to find fun in this game. Maybe it is just not for me.,0
" but the actual game could be described as a bunch of random puzzles, many of which were generic and uninteresting, tied together with a very sparse plot that was ultimately pretty weak.",0
 My game stopped responding.,0
"once you master the economics of the game, the rest of the game and levels become trivial.",0
I got killed by a player during an expedition without knowing that pvp was on. I had significant items in my ship's inventory and on me. The enemy player was in a mech and he instant killed me once on foot and then another time when I entered my ship.,0
"Game worked fine for a while, absolutely loved it. One day it kept crashing and has not worked since then.  Checked all files, deleted the entire game and folders and still no luck. Its a shame.",0
I doubt that it would have dropped before my refund window expiration date.,0
"I should have bought Cooking Simulator VR and the original combo because it was just three dollars more for TWO games, instead I paid double the price for this garbage 1/3 made piece of garbage. ",0
maybe a map once you have discovered zones.,0
less racist for newcomers and there were also TeamKillers.,0
the learning curve absolutely overwhelming.,0
"This game took me 2 hours just to connect to friends. We spent the next few hours trying to get the mission log to work because if it didn't freeze, it would go back 2 missions and have you repeat it.",0
I wasn't able to get far enough to judge this game since I couldn't figure how to make it controller compatible and even though I see it's possible I don't think the game is controller ready yet.,0
"The Weapons fell great, although I would appreciate it if they add more different Weapons, because every AR feels the same and has nearly the same kill time and if they add more customisable weapons, where you can customise everything on your Weapon, that would really fit this game.",0
"The only thing I’d want to see improved is the AI responses and actions to explosions, in game commands and noises. They also move slow to extremely fast in seconds, they are all Olympic competitors.",0
So if you die during that expedition you loose all the progress,0
"You get an interceptor on you and there is no escape. You can run and go into hyperdrive, destroy all their ships, hide out. If there is no way to defeat the enemy, what’s the point?",0

hen game starts mute your mic and sound in discord- all players turn off hud and friendly name plates - only use In-game proximity VOIP to talk- split up into groups of 2-3 or solo around the map- after Round or if a player dies they can unmute in discord but cannot use the in-game VOIP- ,1

I hope they take it even further upon finishing by porting it to virtual reality.,1
I have been waiting for this game since,1
This is a hard and unforgiving game  ,1
"You can play with up to four other people in a group, ",1
"""the movies"" was more funny (fantastic to see the resulting film), was more ""natural"" to play (you immediately knew which roles had to be covered by which characters) and could be played in ""casual""-mode (here events are ""pushed"" towards you).all in all I would have liked more a ""port"" of ""the movies"" than this game :(",1
most hospitals take multiple sessions to beat and some require multiple restarts before you can get going properly.,1
the sound effects puts you in the right place every single time.,2
with modifiers and recent balance changes have made the game more diverse and while still little easy much more agency is allotted to the player to improve reliability while also still being relatively unpredictable,2
I've been a supporter for this game ever since,2
" as you unlock more items, diseases, and rooms you can go back and build up your previous hospitals, raising them to three star levels in your pursuit of perfection.",2
"RP with learning languages and skills, quest, build bases work together or",2
"realistic scenarios and different scenarios such as hostage rescue, bomb threat, active shooter, barricade enemies and raids.",2
the options to play online challenges with friends who also have the game is fun for those who need some more social interaction in the game.,2
"What I actually do want to talk about is the fact that, whatever the state of the game might have been or might become, I really enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the almost surreal atmosphere (literally and figuratively) of a world so seemingly alive and full of things to do that you could study every single life form and landmass across the surface of the immense planets if you so choose. I'm not one for mindless exploration but there's so much to find and so much that caught my eye that I was baffled. Crashed ships, maps, secrets, mysteries and societies to bargain with and even run for yourself.",2
the game does a very good job of making each level interesting from the previous level,2
I started playing again last week and am having a lot of fun with it.,2
I like everything... ,2
some very easy beginner levels with more difficult ones thrown in once you progress further.,2
"i am big on puzzles, and this game definitely fits those categories.",2
""" it is amazing! No Man's Sky also makes me feel alone” which is a good thing. We may be social creatures, but we need time alone: time to think, time to reflect, and time to process our past, present, and future.",2
"i put dozens of hours into this game on Xbox game pass for pc, ",2
yet it pays you back with the amount of awesome content you can unlock ,2
" I have only left my starting solar system twice, maybe 3 times.. . and I still feel like I haven't explored a hundredth of even that.",2
A lot of new content is pushed out in every update ,2
using night vision is cool.,2
without losing your progress.,2
"the building your own stuff was not new to me, but the way two point campus is set up brings a new life to the whole 'build your own', its a whole lot of fun!",2
"The game has a steep learning curve, it's a challenging swat sim that should satisfy hardcore gamers.",2
"There is always something to do, someone to find, neat little things hidden all over and you never know what you will dig into when you go mining.",2
"the game looks great, runs great and plays great.",2
this builds constant sense of anticipation as the player awaits their highest payout of the round and goes long way to make each individual spin maintain sense of excitement even after you have had 20 30 runs of it along with,2
very easy to get the hang of even if you have not played theme hospital before.,2
An incredibly good feeling co-op tactical shooter experience ,2
"I received this game from a friend of mine, it is fully worth the money as I would gladly return it and spend my own money on it in a heartbeat.",2
you are presented with enough monthly and quarterly data that ,2
"great game: cool humor, satisfying gameplay mechanics, reasonable and ""configurable"" pacing - you can move on if you want, you can stay longer to pick up basics and mechanics, so you won not be overwhelmed.",2
"Great gun play,  can play causal/dumb or be super milsimy.",2
 You can get such crazy things like jetpack that emits rainbows or some badass bounty hunter helmet for your character.,2
" and the community is very nice and when you visit the Nexus, people often give you expensive stuff just because why not.",2
 I've ever done I would recommend worth the price,2
"some of the puzzles are a bit complicated, but everything manageable if you just try.",2
but this game stands out very differently from something compared to Rainbow 6 ,2
"He promised the game had changed, that it wasn't the hot mess it had been at launch. I... have to admit that it looked good.",2
it dose lack a little with content and a few bugs but I do think it will get better with some updated versions a content update and/or a dlc ,2
"it is a fun to game to play while listening to podcasts, but the funny voice lies make it worth playing unmuted. Fun and relaxing",2
the story length of the game extends further than one may think. ,2
it provides a very chill and easy experience so you can get that space exploration without a powerful computer or hours of game play practice.,2
 the movement is God tier,2
"Thank you Hello Games Supporting this game that’s been lost to the bigger publishers, and I’m so glad that this still happens here.",2
"All-in-all, a great game for fans of the SWAT series, ",2
I was having a lot of fun with the game making video is for my YouTube channel.,2
There are some weird places and some amazingly beautiful places. You'll find yourself standing overlooking a valley that leads to an ocean with a ringed planet in the sky and the sun(s) setting at the horizon. There's a trade port over there where all sorts of ships are flying in to and out from. There's some weird building guarded by robots that may just have something interesting.,2
"This game is no longer the dud everyone said it was at launch, it has not become one of the best open world games out today.",2
What's better is it isn’t your typical shoot everything that moves game. ,2
"you could play as a galactic photographer, taking pictures across the universe. I enjoy this sort of play.",2
"fun, cartoony graphics ",2
I enjoy this game a lot and it is great to play while listening to podcasts.,2
I absolutely cannot wait for the Steam Workshop and proper modding to come so maps and cool overhaul mods are more accessible and one click away rather than manually placing them on the pack folder.,2
"I play in VR, and with time,  Luckily, the uncomfortableness of the glasses makes it easier to disconnect, take a breather, and then enjoy again another day.",2
I am a huge Tarkov fan,2
 something you would never see from other developers in this day and age.,2
"I enjoyed it immensely and put in a lot of time, making it I believe my highest play time game on Steam as of writing this. ",2
"SWAT 4 for me was easily the pinnacle in tactical FPS games and RON has taken that spot now,  building off of the concept that existed and refining it for a modern gaming generation.",2
I've invested dozens of hours into the game and still have hundreds of hours of gameplay ahead of me. ,2
Maybe it's just because I aspire to be an astronomer and I love space but I would consider NMS to be my new favourite game.,2
it up will potentially have one of the best tactical FPS we have ever seen.,2
I preordered this game because I was so excited for it after playing two point hospital.,2
"is it as good at tph? No. When two point campus was announced I was cautiously optimist,  and for the most part, I was pleasantly surprised. the game uses the same style as two point hospital but the mechanics behind the scenes are very different.",2
I played the crap outta every bullfrog game; theme hospital was the one I preferred.,2
"runs like a dream on my modest gaming laptop,",2
 I am flat out amazed at how much content there is in this game as of May 2022!,2
"The developers brought the game back to life with massive, reputation-changing FREE updates,",2
but I think the devs could learn a bit from Escape From Tarkov,2
"I'm sure it will be better after some time in development, but",2
I am glad that it’s been released for Early Access / BETA. I’m excited to see what other bits are coming after the game is fully released.,2
the satisfaction of winning as a hider or successfully eliminating all the hiders as the seeker is unmatched.,2
and good for screenshot lol,2
realistic and satisfying as hell.,2
"This game makes me feel like both a super survivalist living on a sharp thin edge, or the dumbest most bumbling moron space tourist in the galaxy, only staying alive because the technology is so good. Driving = is a blast, do you have any idea how nice it is to have a starter vehicle that doesn’t flip over\ drift all over the place like everything is ice, or get stopped by tiny bits of terrain or ™¥™¥™¥™¥™¥™¥™¥ ",2
I am a huge fan of building and management games. ,2
I really enjoyed the 5+ actual hours,2
"also there is a fun Facebook group to join as well that is fan ran and creates fun challenges and an open, friendly environment to discuss strategies, stories and get help with anything!",2
" and great graphics,",2
"You are guided on this journey not only by helpful tutorial messages, ",2
"good management choices, , ",2
but at bare minimum I have high respect for the developers for retaining their credibility through actions and not photo shopping a PR statement when making a huge mistake which seems to be the norm nowadays.,2
 as I love this studio and there is a lot of lovely stuff in the game,2
if you enjoyed theme hospital from the late 90 is then this is definitely a game for you.,2
"once you learn how to play it, it is very easy to dominate. I never feared for having money, even at the start of a map, or with really any decision I made. unfortunately, this is also its downfall. ",2
This is probably the best exploration slash survival game out their in general and almost certainly bar none in the sci-fi genre.,2
really fun especially when you communicate with teammates. ,2
This game is pretty good ,2
This is the most underrated title out there imo.,2
" like Battlefield 2042, COD Vanguard, etc.",2
"Very good graphics, ",2
amazing new vibe love it epic and hard and rewarding,2
"incredibly addictive game-play,",2
"His world will take place in a vast world, stripped of its limitations, since all that will appear will be accessible to the smallest of nebulae in the remotest star, not to mention the countless planets or flake the Galaxy. ",2
i have got all the stars and all teh achievements and enjoyed the game.,2
"I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, one handed while I recovered.",2
"From things like proper use of flashlight (if you light the window from the wrong angle it will blind you), through completely unpredictable behavior of enemies like  faking being dead, faking surrender just to shoot at you when you get close, hiding or taking cover in places",2
This game is way to good to pass up especially if you have v desktop and a VR headset takes a while to figure out but is good and ,2
the graphics are wonderful;,2
"added it to my Wishlist, then I finally bought it a couple days ago.",2
"There are half a dozen levels or so to play with different scenarios available to select on each which vary in difficulty (bomb threat, active shooter, hostage rescue to name but a few) ",2
" it is ... a more scaled-back, mindless experience,",2
Who would have thought a 58-year-old grandmother would become a No Man's Sky avid player!,2
"had my reservations, but it is actually pretty good! All of the goodness of the original, with extra added details.",2
"funny radio station, funky music and",2
 and graphics can be adjusted to allow you to enjoy the best experience.,2
I love love love the game due to being an old hospital tycoon player back in the day,2
"""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. "" The 3-rd law by Arthur C. Clarke. I started a review with Clarke's quotation, because the world of ""No Man's Sky"" is really magical despite its obvious sci-fi basis. ",2
it feels like the developers heard all the wishes from players in hospital and made them for campus!,2
thought this game would annoy me but I find it enjoyable escape from reality of real hospital work.,2
easy to control via steam controller.,2
I have hundreds of hours logged in this game,2
Crazy realistic swat vibes that really has never been done before; the game has a lot of detail along with the fact that it feels like you are a swat member absolutely NUTS,2
"I only have one friend that plays the game, but every day we chat about new discoveries that we've made and adventures we've had. This game has honestly made me feel like a kid again.",2
There is a steep learning curve to become familiar with the games technology but that is part of the fun.,2
 for those looking for a realistic tactical response simulation.,2
"The rewarding team play, and complexity of the task involved is an immense sense of satisfaction to navigate.",2
" they combined the regular inventory & cargo slots into one list, and you can now only equip tech upgrades in Technology slots, meaning that any upgrades equipped to a normal inventory slot became unequipped, but was left in your inventory as a regular item that you can just re-equip at any time as long as you have an available tech slot for it. ",2
I'm partial to things such asthis game delivers all that pretty darn well.,2
"I hope the devs look at making an attack and defend type game mode comparable to Rainbow Six Siege, ",2
"Maps are varied in size and design, different scenarios is really cool and keeps the game feeling fresh.",2
rewards curiosity and imagination.,2
"there is a lot of community for it, on reddit, YouTube, discord, and the game is own forums, where you can find strategy guides, tips and people to work with on online projects to unlock additional items.",2
this is worth each and every money I spent.,2
I guess sales will rocket when PvP mode is added.,2
As much as I’ve replayed the maps so it doesn't get very repetitive.,2
"The interface/interaction controls may take some getting used to, but in my opinion, are laid out sensibly.",2
 if the game updates and proves itself.,2
the guns have punch,2
"Time is flying, the earth is rotating, and the no man's sky is still updating.",2
the developer is twisted sense of humor adds to the games enjoyment.,2
while some of the puzzles are solved by random clicking ,2
 Ready or Not provides an opportunity to practice precise discernment and defusing of a situation with as little room for error or injury as possible.,2
 sandbox-style sims games.,2
"I'm 34, I'm old and demanding and I really can't afford to start playing at 5 pm only to end at 2:30 am, wondering, how the hell I'm going to wake up for work (which I did yesterday, thanks to NMS).",2
 and a cryptic story to slowly explore;,2
"A first person shooter that is legitimately terrifying and stressful, ",2
"you can tell that this is not an English game as they offer private tutoring as ""private tuition"" and as a current college student, it makes me laugh a bit to get notifications stating my students completed their ""tuition session"". all in all, fun game.",2
Highly recommended and ,2
have AMD with above recommended hardware.,2
for me it runs smooth as silk at 4k with highest settings. ,2
"it is like theme hospital, clearly in art style and comedy style. ",2
 lots of cute funny characters and hilarious two point radio announcers chatting in the background,2
 lots of fun pop culture references.,2
"every sim game starts out predictable, ",2
"i am big on weird mind-bending stories, and this game definitely fits those categories.",2
"it makes it so you can do whatever you want to without feeling pressured into something specific, but it can also make it feel like there's nothing to do.",2
This game is like rust in space but less chaotic and,2
All that matters is the fun and excitement! ,2
"make sure cleanliness, happiness and boredom are controlled. - recruit and train your employees to perform the tasks you have assigned to them.- accept challenges or patients from other hospitals.-  ",2
"I do feel like I have experienced a small part space while still nearly completing the story, which may speak to its first play through and dare I say replay ability.",2
 Communication and teamwork is essential to complete the challenges that await.,2
The realism in terms of sence is just top notch.,2
"With that being said, I think this game has HUGE potential and if the developers looked at the high-ranking mods that are out for this game and make it part of the game as standard, then it would GREATLY improve the game and its marketing.",2
"In all seriousness this game is brilliant, one of those games where you'll find yourself playing for hours, then rage quit, only to return the day after to try again win then rage quit again ",2
"Multiplayer on Multiplayer mode your can join with your save, get benefits from your save ",2
"Playing this game with a mic is a MUST, communication is very important, this game made me buy a proper headset so I could communicate, ",2
i do miss the old diagnosis but being able to change camera angles and the fun treatment rooms.,2
"I originally played this game on PS4 and it was fantastic, it captured the feel of swinging from the old Spider-Man 2 game while also having the combat from the Arkham games.",2
"When a player settles down on a planet and makes a base, and the things they find there can become interesting just because of the connection to that procedural content.",2
"it has a very awesome design, with very intense situations,",2
"To sum up, I love this game and it is company and",2
This game is a must for anyone with a VR headset.,2
Exploring the universe alongside friends or encountering other players' discoveries,2
"the building mechanics are snappy and easy to use (even if small things do not like to line up perfectly), and",2
 it is a refreshing start to a reboot which features lots of cool modes and environments on how to play and manage a simulation hospital game. ,2
"The graphics are A1,",2
With the different weapons and the fact that there is VOIP and ,2
"This game's story is gripping, fast-paced, action-packed and deep. ",2
 the game also prevents boredom by allowing you to unlock 3 stars on every single hospital.,2
"the game features a range of fun and challenging objectives, from curing illnesses to managing staff, and gives players the freedom to build their own custom hospitals. ",2
 it’ll leave you unable to breath just like George Floyd.,2
"like always, I was tempted to play it due to the influence of gaming youtubers, ",2
"but it again isn't very immersive, usually it only requires you to hold s to auto-target you opponent and hold left mouse, sometimes letting go to cool your gun down so you don't overheat. It's quite simplistic.",2
Update after another 60+ hours: ,2
I enjoy exploration type games that involve vehicles as they really open up the speed you can explore at. The Roamer being my first vehicle that I upgraded fully is the one I have the most experience with. It was interestingly powerful in some cases; wielding a super powerful mining laser that worked quickly and a power scanning system that made tracking specific structures possible.,2
"No Mans Sky gives you the freedom to do whatever you want, while also guiding you along a path that shows you all the game can offer, which is quite a lot.",2
"Cool story concept,",2
New upgrade looks promising.,2
Ready or Not is an extremely fun & challenging shooter that,2
"The story was interesting, as I look back on it, but it was a little bit too non linear and overly complicated by the language system, but I did liked the translator and language learning. ",2
 well over 1100 hrs played.,2
"I did and this game is that imagined game come to fruition! You will build, mine, create, fly, negotiate and hunt down mysterious signals in the single player mode. If story is not your bag, you can just play creative which has zero story, just play.",2
I love this game no one likes it ,2
amzing audio ,2
 the best thing about it is that you can save it to the cloud and come back to it later.,2
which is pretty intuitive and easy to learn.,2
"I played it on xbox on game pass, enjoyed it so much ",2
"I wish all games that labled themselves ""spiritual successor"" were this good.",2
"Its still in alpha, the game still has a long way to go, but the core is there and already it is a lot of fun.",2
"  I saw the teaser trailer back in 2016, ",2
"you cannot afford to take any risks with this game, and every game is different so you never know where the enemies are, or the bombs. Absolute classic which I have no doubt I will still be playing when I'm a really old man.",2
You can learn alien language and ,2
"mercy is not a required quality for this game, but capitalism is lol ",2
Very realistic and looking forward to future development. ,2
and make/explore with friends.,2
I know you want you're game to be realistic.,2
 create an immersive and memorable experience.,2
this game is a true to the heart successor.,2
"All other game companies should be copying Hello Games response to their game releases, they didn’t give up when",2
 Spooky mode is awesome during this festive season.,2
With friends the galaxy feels less empty though.,2
but if you are willing to play what’s here right now it should be a good time.,2
It's an extremely detailed tactical SWAT team simulator. ,2
I like the game and I like two point hospital as well but I had hoped the items had been updated more. ,2
the sound effects of the game are also very creative advantages help make the world feel very much alive ,2
game is on par with games such as escape from Tarkov and Insurgency sandstorm,2
"I have spent an embarrassing amount of time playing two point hospital and the old theme hospital. Starting two point campus, the formulae are already familiar ",2
" it was a flourishing/paradise planet with ancient remains/natural burial sites, and I had the sense of the community kind of ""settling"" the planet themselves to make profit from the resources, just a really nice feeling compared to Version 1.",2
"decent graphics, and really cute, and well thought out vibes, that really make this a fun game to play, and",2
"encourages and rewards teamplay and information based combat, and offers an increasing number of tools to solve situations.",2
at making the players feel nervous and tense as well as ,2
