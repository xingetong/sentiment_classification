"deceptive advertising

Today I bought this Square-Trade 4-year ""protection"" plan for a small appliance purchase. The plan expires 4 years from today. The manufacturer provides a one year warranty on the item; thus Square-Trade is really only selling a 3 year extension of the manufacturers warranty. You should call it what it is.",0

"With such great reviews, I was hopeful

With such great reviews, I was hopeful, but this is not a good quality DVD player. The screen looks terribly washed out, even after trying to darken and adjust contrast; the volume doesn‚Äôt go very loud, so it‚Äôs hard to hear in the kitchen (where so usually use my portable player when I‚Äôm baking); and it doesn‚Äôt save you place on the disc when it powers off, so you have to fast forward to get to your spot. Overall, this is very meh. Returning it to find something better.",0
"Even too loud with ear plugs!

Extremely loud, to the point of having to leave the room and the motor has to run excessively long to fill the tank. Have to wonder how it is even legal. The coiled air hose it too tightly formed to be of any use. Might as well just be a short piece of hose. Had I not left it sitting in the box for months before trying it I would have sent it back.",0

So just got this in the mail, opened it up, charged it for 2 hours. bind it to the phone through the app. Then nothing, it wont track steps, heart rate works for one reading, but one minute it says 93 bpm, the next 48 bpm.

"Hella disappointed

Where do I start. To say the book was short is an understatement, you can snap your fingers and the book will be over. Not only is the book short there no ending. She just ends the story in Tony and Virginia and goes back to Benjamin Lee. The very few chapters in the book is and that its. In the summary it talks about Tony story, but yet she manged to put a whole section of Benjamin Lee oppose to finishing out Tony story.Save your money this is an incomplete book.",0

"Breaks off of chain

It's very cute and looks just like the picture but it broke off of the chain after only a few months of use and I didn't jerk it. The fan doesn't have a wall switch and therefore requires the chain to function. It's probably fine if you don't pull the chain very often.",0

I had liked the while idea as an over the road truck driver that in case of emergencies I can use it. But first initial use of filling up the holding tank, it would leak where the flushing pump is. Complete pissed me off! So, I am trying to fix it myself. That putty that they use doesn't make a complete seal to keep water in. I removed the putty the best that I could and put clear silicone in place if it. Now I will find out if it does not leak.",0
"Only 90 capsules, not 120 as shown. Buyer beware!

Definitely not what I thought I was getting. It does not cover as much as the pictures show (and I have a short torso), it rolls down, and didn't smooth or flatten anything. Instead it made me look round and pregnant. I ordered a 3X and you can tell they are made for smaller people, not truly for bigger girls that have a little more to smooth out. Very disappointed.",0

"Worked first time, sheared bolt the second.

I originally bought this in 2016 to tighten a new yoke nut on my motorcycle. It worked fine; I heard the click at the appropriate setting. Not sure how accurate it was but assumed it was good to go based on all the high reviews. Today for the second time in two years, I needed a torque wrench. I‚Äôve had my Tekton stored in a closet in its protective case and at the lowest torque setting as per the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions. I needed 10 ft lb torque (the lowest setting on my wrench) to torque two swing arm spools. On the first, it came very close to stripping the bolt, and I never heard a click but decided to stop before it got completely stripped. I blamed myself and assumed I had my allen bit at an angle. On the second spool I slowly twisted the wrench and again, no click. What I did eventually hear was the bolt being sheared in half. I was able to twist the broken half out of the swing arm, but there‚Äôs some damage to the black paint of the swing arm on a 2018 Yamaha R6. I‚Äôm going to try to get the company that makes the spools to send two more bolts, in the event it was their hardware, but I have ordered a different brand of torque wrench to try. I have a feeling it‚Äôs the wrench that caused the issue, as many of the 1 star reviews mention sheared bolts and the wrench not clicking or working for very long. And that makes sense. It‚Äôs $35-40 and made in Asia. If you want a quality mechanics torque wrench you probably have to man up and pay at least $150 for a CDI or $500 for a Snap On. I bought this cause I‚Äôm not a full time mechanic, but I‚Äôd rather not have a torque wrench than have one I can‚Äôt trust to not destroy my vehicles.",0

I've purchased many OXO products and loved every one of them. This one is not good. I had an OXO tea kettle just like it (except it didn't have the brushed finish) for many years, and it was great. I was expecting the same of this one. Unfortunately, this one developed rust spots inside within the first few weeks of owning it. OXO was very receptive to my complaint and quickly sent me a new one, however I'm concerned that the same thing will happen with this replacement. Also the new ones just aren't as sturdy and well made as the older one.",0

They are really cute toys but after one bath they already have a lot of water in them and are very hard to empty or remove the water.

I needed it to be more than that and it‚Äôs claims that it could last longer are not true for what I needed it to do. I drive long distances more than 8 hours and I need my computer.

"Tight fit, heel balling is bad.

First of all, the sizing on these is absolutely insane. I have fairly average sized feet, I wear a 9.5 shoe. These things are a chore to get on they are so tight. Once they're on, the stitching around the toe is very pronounced and goes right across the front of your toes and overlaps on the side, which means you really feel it when your foot touches the sides of your shoe. Secondly, I don't believe the material listing is correct. I bought these as they are listed as being mostly synthetic which should prevent balling on the heel, a problem I've faced with non synthetic socks. One pair that I've worn a whopping 3 times already has significant balling on the heel. I bought these socks at the same time as some synthetic Adidas socks to see which were better, and the Adidas socks show no sign of balling on the heel. Would not buy again.",0

Not even a couple days of his rough play and he had made holes in them. They are very well made and super cute. Just not for a kid who‚Äôs always playing and dragging around. He‚Äôs just 3 y/o and very active.",1

"A little short for my liking

I ordered this in navy, and the color is as pretty as I expected. It is made of a lightweight, stretchy material, so it fits a little snuggly around the chest and arms. I like the way it flares out without looking like a maternity dress. However, it is a little too short for my liking. It is just at my fingertips when my arms are down at my sides. I almost sent it back for this reason, but decided to just wear it with thicker leggings. It will look nice with a scarf or a long pendant necklace.",1

I wanted to love this mouse I have been very pleased with redragon mice in the past this one sadly falls short of even my logi g502. The second row of buttons are very weak in this they feel worn out and it is new, I am expecting the others to feel the same very soon, the plastic is not like their previous product it feels very cheep in hand, the mode selector is on the bottom so quick access is not there with no way to validate other than opening the software to see what mode your in, finally even though the extra step feels good on the fingers it makes the base so wide if there is any uneven part of your desk it will teeter todder and miss inputs. For the price it is a good piece to test but I would recommend from my expirence paying 20$ more for another brand. Positives it does feel nice in hand even with the cheap plastic, the software is surprising doing well, easy to use and gives you multiple options such as double keying, lastly even though the side buttons need some love to input there are enough buttons to make anyone happy.",1

Based on reviews, I decided to try out this Yorkshire blend of black teas. Turned out quite weak after 5 minutes of brewing; with no distinctive flavor or aroma. It was only 3.99 for 100, so its no big loss. We also use tea bags to add color to some curry dishes, and it certainly fits that function.",1

"Feels pretty good for plantar fascia pain.

Definitely not the magical solution. They are nice because they do not move around much in your shoe and do provide some support and stimulation to the foot. I did think they would be a little more firm so that was disappointing. Overall not bad but I prefer some of longer (3/4 length of your foot) and more stable inserts out there. If the only problem you have is pain in the heel, rather than elsewhere in the foot, these are worth a try and are not overly expensive.",1

I cannot comment on battery life, but overall this device is good. Unlike some cheap air fly mice I used in the past, the mouse pointer of this one moves quite accurately and I would have given it 5 stars if it wasn't for the annoying fact that each time I need to move the cursor across the screen, I need to click the laser pointer button to activate it.",1
"The chair you want to love but hate

I am 5.9 tall, weight 159 pounds, work IT, and sit about 12 hours a day. I have long legs, wear shorts most of the time, and move a lot, so the need for having a flexible chair is a must to have. This chair you need patience, patience, and a good back before you decide to put it together. There are so many small parts and somewhat complicated instructions that lack details. The tools kit that comes with the chair is useless. The wrench slips a lot, so expect to bump your fingers around the chair inners(not a pleasant experience). Once you managed to put it together, adjusting the chair is another headache on its own! This is where I am debating on returning or keeping this chair. There are six knee positions you can adjust this chair, and that is great, but the problem with is that you need to remove a long bolt holding the chair against a wall to stop it from collapsing flat on the growing-risking snapping your fingers-. There's another adjuster that it's designed to adjust the height, you have to get off the chair eyeball it to what you might like, sit and if that does not work, get back off and readjust again. You can't adjust it while sitting unless you have a strong grip, and I lift. In all, this is my first week using the chair, and already feel the benefit of having a knee chair. It helps balance the weight on my lower back. It's very comfortable, feels great moving around my workstation. I will def use it and if I decide to keep it will have to remove bolts to it from scratching me. Notes to the manufactures: 1. adjusters should be improved or made to where anyone can adjust while sitting. 2. the screws and bolt design should be revised. 3. the sitting is too steep, it would be nice that it can also be adjustable.",1

I was required to get this edition for my Music 101 class and can not be more satisfied with the edition. The redeeming factor about this copy was that it is well used. The front cover of the paperback is bent on two of its four corners and the book itself looks well read through with discolored copies. I highly suggest using this if you need to rent a book since it came within a Prime 1 day shipping and arrived in less than 24 hours. Just know it is a used rental book and you are getting the price you paid for, don't expect the new $170 copy.",1

I was really excited about this bottle since it doesn‚Äôt contain any plastic. It works to hold water and seals well, however, the main problem for me is that it traps mildew very easily and makes it smell bad. I‚Äôve had several other Kleen Kanteen bottles that don‚Äôt do this. I really wanted to like this bottle but due to the mildew smell (and I wash it regularly) it makes me not want to use it.",1
"Hard to hold onto

I use this with my Lenovo Yoga 730. I am a little disappointed because it is very hard to hold onto. It's heavy. It's slides through my hand and the placement of the buttons has me constantly pushing them while writing and trying to hold onto the pen. I tried to put a grip on the pen but that holds the buttons down, so that's not an option. I also don't like that it doesn't flow across the screen with ease when writing. I wish they could've put some more thought into the tip material they decided on so it would be more like writing on paper and not sticky. I just don't think it was quite time to release it.",1

Well, I bought this because i thought the top was fun. I am 53 and weigh 125 and I purchased a medium. I wasn't sure about the bottoms and they are a little weird. They fit but the cut is just sorta awkward. Not very flattering on me...but they might be flattering and someone younger. They are cheeky which was fine, it's the weird strap that makes it odd. The top is pretty loose and the bottoms are snug. Bigger bottoms might fit better but then the tops would literally fall off of me. For the price, I am going to keep because I pared the top with different bottoms and it's adorable.",1

It works great as a backpack but the grey is not really grey it has a purple tinge to it. Also, the tightening of the straps is not the easy pull to tighten and lift to loosen. You have to take the time to push the straps through to loosen. Not that big of a deal but I have a tendency to do that a lot with different outings. But everything else is good.",1

"Too few screws

Honestly, I would have given this 5 stars because it was exactly what I needed and seems to be doing great at getting my cats not to scratch my new furniture.

Mine only came with 14 screws, so most of the panels aren't attached at the bottom and are curling up.",1

"Ugh, the SMELL.

First things first, this is not for heavy chewers. But it is very heavy and thick, and large. In fact if you want it just for a display toy it works for that, too. It is obviously bendy rubber, but there are no wires in it to hold a pose. That being said, it smells pretty awful. I wouldn't call it a bad smell per se, just a persistent, permeating sickly sweet chemical odor that will literally stink up the room. I had it sitting on top of the entertainment center and the whole TV room reeks of it. If you wash it in warm water with dish soap, it sort of helps eliminate a little of the smell, but not by much. Over time it has been lessening, but we're talking weeks. It probably won't bother some people, however if you're particularly sensitive to smells like I am, this will get on your nerves. If your dog is chewing on it or you're wrestling with it, the smell becomes renewed, over and over again. It's not an expensive toy and no doubt some people might want it just because it's a really cool, big Gumby figure. But whether you want it as a collectible sort of thing or a dog toy, the smell is annoying and just doesn't go away.",1

Next, I was very upset when I noticed that the design was scratching off in several places. I realize that this is most likely from shoving the phone roughly into pockets, but it is still upsetting and shows how cheap the design material is.

This cream has a very dewy texture which is nice for dry skin. However it also has a very heavy fragrance added which is really unnecessary. It has a very strong smell like sticky sweet canned frosting. I like sweets but not on my face! I don't know why the manufacturer found it necessary to add this fragrance. It's annoying and makes me think twice about reordering this product. I purchased this due to the higher percentage of glycolic and lactic acids and more natural ingredients it contains but because of the strong odor, I will probably go back to using my Studio 35 cream when this product is used up.

One of the 2 sensors were defective and could not pair to thermostat.Return for replacement. Hope replacement works properly.",1
"Easy to use - did the trick

Easy to use - did the trick! However - the clamp was a bit broken and so I had to pinch the hose myself which can get... messy. Water squirting everywhere out of the hose is not something you're looking to deal with while also trying to administer an enema. Further - the box was damaged. The products were unopened and unused, but the box was thoroughly beat up - scratched, dinged, torn at some corners.",1

Very thin, not what I was expecting. Barely does its job.",1

Works like average potting soil",1

Ok product but it move out of place way to easy needs some kind of pad strip to stop it from moving",1
"Some tweaking will help parents

I don‚Äôt know what it tastes like but baby doesn‚Äôt mind taking it, so I suppose it‚Äôs ok. I prefer the dispenser that has the long dropper that can be put in baby‚Äôs mouth rather than this type of dropper. I find that the only way to use this one is to place a drop into something the baby is going to eat/drink since you cannot effectively dispense the amount indicated if dropper is in baby‚Äôs mouth. And if it‚Äôs not in baby‚Äôs mouth, product ends up in the drool that is forever coming since baby is teething. Very inconvenient for a 6 m/o.",1
"It's good for walking around

Okay overall. It's good for walking around, but not for they gym. It needs an air pressure valve because in the gym when you want to drink more quickly it feels like your head's going to implode from sucking so hard.",1
"Meh

It looks good but the raised lines (the blue) are pretty uncomfortable. If all you care about is looks, buy this... if you want comfort, stay away.",1
"Three Stars

Smaller than what it looks like, but got power üîã",1
"it has been good.

Gave this as a Christmas present. None of the hardware was in the box. Instead of the hassle of returning the product, my son-in-law went to hardware store and found pieces to fit it. Other than that, it has been good.",1
"Very disappointed.

Curtains are acceptable however there are no matching tie-backs. It's going to be really tough to find matching material to make them. Curtains like this should have tiebacks included. .",1

I enjoyed the first book (1000 White Women) much more. I thought this was a bit flat compared to that. However, it was a decent read.",1
"What

A lot small, maybe fit a woman or a teenager, not a grown man",1
"Not really good enough, even for the price.

These things work, Kind of. They really don‚Äôt meet the standard for call quality, sound quality, range, or ease of set up. They re comfortable, but don‚Äôt operate to the typical users satisfaction. If given a 2nd chance, I would choose differently.",1

They are see through",1

Nice fabric. Very thin. No zipper at one end. I think slightly cheap. Would rather pay more for a better fitted quality so pillow case.",1

I took them religiously like the directions said, but I had an adverse reaction to them, and had to stop",1

They are very soft, but leaving fuzz balls all over my house. Also, shipping took forever.",1

I only received a backpack and a water bottle. I need the other items ASAP. This pack is a gift!",1

I had to return this product as the screwdriver supplied was worthless to unscrew the screws on my Fitbit.",1
"Size 12-14 fits just right an 11 year old

I bought this for a thin 11 year old. It's just right for him, and not sure it would be a good fit next year. Disappointed.",1
"Beautiful but sizing seems to be off

This jacket is very pretty and well made. The sleeve, shoulder and jacket length were perfect but the sleeve width was pretty snug and the front didn't come anywhere close to touching in the chest. I gave it three stars partly because the fit ran small from my normal size (also my measurements matched the size chart for the size I bought) but mostly my rating is because the side slit pockets fell behind my hips rendering them useless. They were very noticeable as the lining showed each time I bent, turned or sat.",1
"A lot of bands for the price

The bands I did like, but there isn‚Äôt much difference between the strength of them",1
"Scratchy

Bought this for my wife, and she did not like it at all. Very ruff, scratchy feeling to it. Extremely thin material. Much smaller than expected. She wears mediums in pretty much everything, but this medium felt like a small on her.",1

They are ok.. not my favorite",1

Basically a near rip of an earlier work and TV series - Wish me Luck.",1

Nice quality, but should have purchased the next size up for all 3 pairs.",1

Didn't really see what the rave was all about.",1

Plot was a little thin. But, an interesting story. Characters are mostly believable. I enjoyed the book. Would be a great beach read.",1
"Lasted one day

1 year old mixed boxer tore the rug up in 2 hours. I then spent the next hour picking up all the little pieces. May not be the fault of the maker, but you all with young dogs should beware. I'm now search for a more durable outdoor entry rug.",1
"Does not work well

This item does not work well. It comes out very easily. Just picking up a wash cloth from the sink can dislodge it and before you know it your water has drained out. I push it in as hard as I can but it doesn't stay in place. I would not recommend these.",1
"Cute

Very cute. Thinner fabric but hangs nicely.",1
"meh

Wasn't for me. I live in an apartment complex and in the winter it was not fun to have to carry my clothes outside to walk them to the apartment laundromat. I got this to get me through until my lease was up. It was ok, if you dont care about your clothes being soft and fluffy like they are from a dryer then you might like it. My clothes got clean but certain items I didnt like washing in it. I would not buy it again, I didnt think it was worth the convenience.",1
"Fabric is very thin

I wear a 3X, or a 20-24 in plus size. I ordered a larger size because I saw others posting about the fit. Glad I did! Fabric is a bit thin, so this shirt won‚Äôt last long.",1
"comfort

I like these slippers ,had a few pairs before. But this time they are not as comfy,due to not being made right ,the soles were not sewed on right I can feel the sole inside the slipper on my feet!! not a happy camper this time.",1
"Works as expected

Works as expected, not as heavy as advertised.",1
"Great at first, Velcro wore out.

Started out loving this, 8 months later and the Velcro is wore out and doesn‚Äôt stay shut. Maybe a snap or a loop and hook would work better. Already looking for another brand to try out!",1

As others have said the hat is made to fit a round head. I do not have a round head. It is soft enough to make it fit. I did not try wetting it to re-shape but if I use it again I will.",1
"Chips

I really like the Corelle dishes but in less than 2 months I have chips in 2 bowls already. They don‚Äôt seem as durable as the plates. Older style plates I have from Corelle seem thicker and more resistant to chips.",1

"Unfortunately I threw away the packaging so now I have 2 pill containers that are truly no good to me

As many stated, the tops do not close securely. I thought I would give them a try and YUP the reviews are right. I turned the container over to get medicine out and all of them went all over the floor. I had to gather them quickly as my GSD came running into the kitchen. Unfortunately I threw away the packaging so now I have 2 pill containers that are truly no good to me.",1
"Great concept.... Just not good enough for larger, heavier, phones.

Great concept, but doesn't work on heavier larger phones like the Note 8. The phone is simply too heavy with a basic style case.The slightest bump will cause the phone to slip off the mount and fall to the floor, potentially damaging your phone. Unfortunately this resulted in me returning this, as it simply did not work as well as I had hoped for my Note 8.",1
"It works, but needs physically altering to get the pieces together

There is a piece of plastic sticking out of the plate that prevents the two pieces from fitting together like they are supposed to. After not getting any support from vendor, I used pliers to tear that piece of plastic off. Fits fine now and will probably do just what it is supposed to. But they missed something in the final development of it, there's a little plastic piece that juts out that doesn't need to be there. It's not even listed on the vendors web site, so I am assuming it is a really new product.",1

I really did not notice a difference after taking the product for over 2 weeks. No change in energy, how I felt or appearance. I would mix the powder and drink first thing each morning.",1
"Its great!

I have been using it for several months now. It does work, but you have to be consistent. I use it, my wife uses it, and my son uses it. Its great !",1
"Big feet are needed

They were easy to assemble. You need very big feet in order for them to fit properly. I had my husband use them. They worked good.",1
"Both work fine since I fixed

Had to take one apart and fix",1

Completely different from the picture! Very disappointed that the color is not the same as the one I ordered",1

They don't really help with the glare at night on rainy days as much as I would like. But it just could be I am getting old.",1
"A bit lacking

For the re release I received a copy through Netgalley. I really wanted to love this book, hot cop on the cover could never be bad. But, Cade and Katrina just didn't seem to fit the way I thought they should. She should have been grittier and tougher, not just aggressive sexually. He didn't have the depth to his story that I would have expected from a Marine. The story sort of jumped around, periods of time advanced quickly within a page, leaving out details that I wanted. It an interesting storyline, creative and steamy.",1
"AT LEAST ONE SIZE TOO LARGE. VERY DISAPPOINTED

Was at least one size TOO BIG!! Price was good. Shoes seemed well made but way too big",1

Not a bad game. Bonus money could be more. Some of the games are a little childish",1

Social Tea has changed over the years. It's too hard now and that nice creamy taste is gone.",1
"I was very disappointed with this

I was very disappointed with this. It doesn't work the way it looks in the commercials. Its as if its too flimsy for the plastic to stand the way you want it to. Then the pen just stopped working after 2 min. I don't recommend this product to anyone. I love the idea behind this so much that I will give another brand a chance.",1

Great bike, but a few of the accessories arrived broken. Item too bulky to ship back. Needs new reflectors and seat (small tear). Only 2 weeks old",1
"Good value

Works pretty good but they tend to get little balls all over them as you use them. Nobody really sees your socks anyway so it‚Äôs not a big deal",1
"Works but...

Double sided tape did not work, had to use my own. Other then that works fine.",1
"Quality Declining

I bought one in 2017 and decided to buy another because I liked it a lot. Currently, the quality has gone down. The leather doesn‚Äôt seem as good quality and the color is red not a dark brown. However it has the number of pages I want and I like that the back cover is different from my first purchase. Do think I would buy again though.",1
"Ridiculous sizing chart..

Sizes are stated incorrectly. Quality is excellent but what good is it if you can't wear them?",1
"Probably works well; I can't get beyond the imperfection in the surface

I was willing to pay a little more to get a great quality travel mug. I will never know if the mug itself was a good value. The chip in the color (a thin film surrounding the mug?) upon arrival convinced me that it could never hold up to how I will treat it. Bummer.",1
"I like them, but..

I do like these, but the picture is very deceptive, I was expecting to get dark amethyst, when they were extremely light.",1
"Kind of works

Not enough friction on the slide. Moves on its own when opening and closing washer.",1
"Didn't work for me

Purchased four. One had no charge at all. Didn't use as they were too small to hold up my chest top. There may have been a description that described how large a top these could support, but I didn't see it.",1
"Purchase for art only

Good art value but not very functional. You only get one not three as shown in the picture",1

Output is okay, but it doesn't attach securely. So 90% of the time when flipping it over, water leaks (in a big way, sometimes). It works for my needs, but it's not great.",1

Quite rigid cable. Don't like the cable. But it works without issues.",1
"Not fresh despite being 4 months away from ""best by"" date

Maybe it improperly stored but I was kind of disappointed that the product was not fresh despite being 4 months away from the expiry date. They were kind of firm like they were drying out, and the chocolate chips were turning white. I also wish that the chocolate chip coverage was more generous; some pieces had no chocolate at all. They are a bit pricey for marshmallows too. Overall, I like them; it's just that this particular batch was disappointing.",1
"Low Quality Fabric

Pretty and comfortable top, but the fabric is low quality. I bought this to wear postpartum, and, 3 months after I had my baby, it's pilled all over and looks very used. Disappointing.",1
"Comfy but stretches out too quickly

Fit perfectly out of the bag but after just a few wears, it was too loose even on the tightest hooks. Not offered in 32 so I can't get a smaller one. Bummer. Really comfortable.",1
"Cheap, good for little kids not teens

Very cheap feeling, good for a little girl maybe. Not for a older teen for sure.",1

Weird material but fit pretty well. I wouldn't purchase again but I'm fairly satisfied considering the price.",1

Yellow and green would not work no matter what I did.",1
"If You MUST Have An Air Fryer This Is A Good Option

Had been wanting an air fryer for some time now. To be honest, now that I have one I'm wondering why I wanted it. Ours sits seldom used. It does not save time, has limited cooking space and is just one more thing to clean after dinner. Though this one is easy to clean. If you are looking to get one this is a pretty good quality unit. Works as advertised for the most part. One drawback is the rotisserie feature. Don't get me wrong. It functions properly, unless you put a bird on it. I put a small chicken in and the legs and wings constantly dragged the bottom. Kept waiting for the gears to break. To the manufacturer's credit the machine pushed right on through. If I do another chicken I will probably tie it with some cooking twine. If you must have an air fryer this is a good one to have. Personally I'd rather use my oven.",1
"Satisfy although its a small pouch

Served its purpose. Satisfy although its a small pouch.",1
"Does its job, but looser around the system than I would like

Not sure why but the case is actually loose around the top and bottom of the switch. The back of it fits right, its just like the opening portion had been stretched out and it hasnt regained its intended shape yet. It is a very minor inconvenience though.",1
"Simple, Good Little Heater

Nothing special. No heat control. There is a safety feature (turns off when it's knocked over). However, beware that the screen does get very hot to the touch. I keep this under my desk at work and it works just fine. Not overly warm, but does the trick. This is definitely a one-person heater. Don't expect this to warm up a room.",1
"Pros - nice beginner set

Pros - nice beginner set. Like the water base paints and easy clean up. Bought these for my 9 year old granddaughter. The pallet is small but the holes for paint are deep. The paint brushes seem nice. A little disappointed the set is so small. I expected the case to be bigger overall. Thought I should get more for the money.",1

A lot smaller than I thought",1
"Choking hazard clip snaps off

After a month of use noticed that plastic clip popped off which is choking hazard.",1

Quality product, sturdy and attractive; however, the height is about 3-4 inches to tall. It is an odd height and although it is usable as is I would have been much happier with and given it 5 stars if this detail wasnt missed.",1
"Three stars

I bought these to help my hair stay up while straightening it. My hair is very curly and pretty thick. I‚Äôd say these are useable BUT not the greatest for my hair. So I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for hair types like mine but they are good clips!",1

"Beautiful, but not easy to set up

Beautiful set of decorations... but there were no instructions of how to put everything together. I had to come back to this to look at the photo to figure out what all these pieces were supposed to go to. AND... I must say... the white(ish), gold and blue tassel banner was next to impossible to put together.",1
"Protective but cheap-feeling

I generally prefer Apple cases, but since they haven't seen fit to release any for the XR I decided to give this a shot. It's okay. It fits snugly on all sides and doesn't add too much bulk, but the material has a tacky, oily quality that feels unpleasant in the hand compared to the phone's glass back panel. The way light refracts through the edges of the case gives them a yellowish hue that looks kind of nasty. The inside of the case also creates strange rainbow patterns where it sticks to the phone's glass back, similar to a puddle of oil. There is also a bunch of text visible on the edges of the case that looks weird and unnecessary. Ultimately this case seems like it will do a decent job of keeping my phone safe, but I can't say I find it particularly pleasant to hold compared to a caseless phone or an Apple-made case.",1
"Needs more!!!!

It needs more product fir the price.",1
"Might be good for a dog with a different chest size than my dog

This harness seemed good overall, but I returned it because the plastic adjusting clip thing ended up in the armpit of my 90 pound Rottweiler, and I was afraid it would be uncomfortable and rub for her.",1

This is ok...smells a little chemically. The carpet feels fresher after using.",1
"Disappointed

These plants were disappointing, dried out and brown. I'm still working to rejuvenate them, but not having much luck.",1
"Messed up my fog lights.

I have a 3rd gen Toyota 4-Runner. I have to manually turn off my fog lights before I can use high beams. Also I can't turn off the lights. This is because the 4-Runner trys to run the lights in ""daylight mode"". To do this it pulses the lights on and off very quickly. With incandescent bulbs the effect is to dim the lights, but with these it just causes them to flicker. Finally the 5000K color may look brighter when you see the car, but doesn't necessarily make the road brighter. It really feels like you are driving with moonlight. Now, when I have low beams on and someone flashes their brights at me I can't flash my brights back. The effect is that rather than going to high beam, my fog lights just turn off. Now with low beam AND my fog lights on its not so bad since my fog lights add a small amount of yellow color which makes for a more natural view.",1
"Great shampoo; packaged for shipment poorly

I like this shampoo, but gave it only 3 stars because the shampoo arrived with a loose top and product leaking into the box. The shampoo was not wrapped in plastic like most other liquid products are from Amazon.",1
"Beware these are not the size that are in the ...

Beware these are not the size that are in the picture.. They say they are light blocking but they really aren't that dark. I have some I bought from target and they do not let any light in! These aren't worth the money!",1
"Beautiful story, poorly executed.

This is a very beautiful story, based on a real experience, of a man redeeming himself for his mistakes while on his death bed. We really need more movies like this. Our last moments on earth are an important time of reflection and truth, but we rarely ever see it on film. This said, I give it 3 stars only for having a good purpose. It's a two star production with amateur acting, directing, and writing. There were times I wanted to throw something at the screen because the lines the actors said were not what any logical person would say! It's like a rough first draft that could be remade into something to be proud of. If you're a trooper for poor quality films about faith and love, go for it.",1
"Not bad

It works but seems like a temporary fix.",1
"Three Stars

cute but the leather started peeling after about 2 weeks.",1
"Shower mirror? Yes. Fogless? No.

Fogged up within the first week of purchase, so if that is your main goal this won't work. However, I give it the three stars because so far it's been a sturdy shower mirror that I wipe the fog off every few seconds when shaving.",1
"head part is loose

i ended up return it because the head keep coming off",1
"Not good customer service on providing refund

I loved the ring, used as a fill in when leaving the country going on vacation. size I picked was too big, so had to order a smaller size. waiting on the refund on the initial ring bought is like waiting for rain in a drought. Plus cannot get in touch with anyone regarding my refund!!!",1
"It's not gonna be waterproof this one. But it will serve the purpose of protection

It seemed alittle cheaply made but it worked. Like it wouldn't close all the way into the phone so no way it would withstand water but it was a good product for the most part.",1
"Cheaply made.

This is definitely a LARGE pillow, as it can fit our German Shepherd with lots of wiggle room. The color is very vibrant and the fabric is easy to wipe clean... however it needs a lot more stuffing in my opinion as it says in certain areas, and you have to ""re-fluff"" it more often than I would like.",1
"Glad for easy prime returns

Slightly see through, no collar, does not button all the way. Glad for easy prime returns",1
"Nice looking caps, but too short for the valve stems

I really like the way these valve caps looks and was excited to get them on my truck. However, when I put them on, they were too short and did not cover the whole stem. I ended up not using them, but am using the key chain. It's well made and also looks good.",1
"Impossible

Very hard to put on. I bought another pair.",1
"Second time around was fine. Slightly off white

First came damaged. Second time around was fine. Slightly off white, almost a cream color. Bought for my son's prom. It wouldn't be a good daily wear, but good for a one or two time use.",1

It had a chemical smell when I opened the package. And it's really way too big. I looked warm but sadly it's going back.",1

"stinky

Extremely strong chemical (insecticide?) smell upon arrival. Made the whole house smell. Washed it and hung it on line to dry and I could smell it 30 feet away. Have washed it two more times and while the smell is decreased, I still can't stand the smell. Contacted seller and they are going to send me a detergent to try. They also offered to take it back. While the price seemed good, it won't be if it has ruined my washing machine as others mentioned. I wanted it for my cat to sleep on but may have to send it back. My guess is any blanket like this made in India will have been treated with insecticide to allow it to be imported to USA.",1
"Performs as Expected, Just Smaller than Wanted

Well constructed pan, just smaller than I wanted (my own fault). I use this to cook bacon on an outdoor grill that has a side burner. It works well for that but I can only get 6 slices of bacon on this pan. So, hardly worth the effort to use it over the round pan.",1

I love, love, love this pillow case. I have had it for a few months now and it has held up beautifully. I bought a silk pillow with the intention of the promised improvement to my skin and hair. Though, it hasn‚Äôt been a miracle cure for hair breakage, I have noticed an improvement in my skin and hair. It also features a zipper closure, which keeps the pillow case from slipping off. The only set back is that you have to take special care when washing, but it is definitely worth it. I also get extremely hot when I sleep and this pillow case has made sleeping much cooler.",2

"Great Tongs!

These tongs are amazing! They have a great feel to them and are extremely sturdy! The silicon tips are easy to clean and hold up to high heat with no melting whatsoever. These tongs have a nice weight to them so they are not going to bend when picking up heavier things, such as a heavy pieces of meat. I like that they close and open by pulling/pushing the tab on the end of them.

Very neat for my First Graders but a little hard to use. They don't mind because this stuff is so popular right now.

I'm very happy with this bag. I was hesitant to purchase because the purple in the product picture is very saturated, but I gave it a shot based on the review photos. The purple is perfect, much better in person. The bag is small but it holds the cases for my .40 and 380, plus plenty of boxes of ammo. There's a divider in the middle compartment that keeps the ammo boxes in place. There are 4 pockets around the outside that are spacious, and there's plenty of room in one pocket to hide my extra necessities. The bag is well made and I'd highly recommend it to any person looking for color instead of a basic black bag.",2
"A bit small.

Works fine, but the size: A biggish salad for one or 2 small side salads. Really a bit too small for two, whereas the regular size version is a bit too big. I am goldilocks and I can't find a salad spinner sized to suit...",2

The material and construction of it is top notch, just a bit large and awkward to grasp and use for a man with fairly short hair to use.",2
"Excellent Value

Really soft and not too heavy. My only criticism is that I would have liked it to be a bit wider. It's probably fine if you just have one person in the bed, but once you get 2 bodies underneath it there's not a lot of extra comforter on the sides. But it's very durable. I bought this as a quickie replacement after a cat puke incident with my old comforter and I'm happy with the purchase.",2

I ordered these for my 3 year old niece and my sister has learned a lot of different hair styles.",2
"pretty to wear once in awhile

It is pretty, however, I only gave it a 4 star because, of the sizeing. This ring runs one whole size off. If you wear a size 6 then by all means order a size 7. It does not look like diamonds maybe because, it is not diamonds but, as for costume jewelry it is nice. Will it turn at some point? Probably but, check the price you get what you pay for. All in all not a bad ring.",2

"Really loud!

I like these alarms, I gave one to my daughter, one to my granddaughter and kept one for myself. The noise is REALLY loud and it's easy to pull the cord and set it off, but not so easy that I'm worried that I'll set if off by accident.",2
"Would recommend

lasted longer than the original Lava Lamp bulb I was using..",2
"Almost to good...

I love this Mic for recording rap and pop vocals, but be extremely careful on how your using it with your home studio setup. Its almost to sensitive. You can literally hear birds chirping outside and the sound of the air circulating in the room. Can be a good thing or a bad thing, as long as you make sure you plan ahead and make the correct setting adjustments and use a high pass filter. Some great plug ins that can help with that as well. Also, make sure this is the right mic for you in terms of the type of vocals you plan on recording. I use it for pop and rap vocals, which to me sound great, but others have advised against.",2
"Not exactly hypo allergenic.

Still have eye irritation when using but not as bad as the store brands.",2
"Works well, but you'll need to stabilize the bottom

It keeps my leash chewing dog in the back seat. I had to add an extra bungee cord in the middle bottom to stablize it. Otherwise it is only attached to headrests and the dog would be able to squeeze underneath the middle by pulling it back. I put it around the center console and it works perfectly.",2

"works well!

This bey comes in three parts (top, center, and bottom) and is meant to explode (hence beyblade BURST). Good quality, and comes with a string launcher (launcher with retractable string pull). This beyblade ONLY WORKS with included launcher or any other LEFT spinning launchers (but be careful not to over pull the string, it WILL break! It can be repaired with a phillips head screwdriver, so dont worry if it does). It is the ONLY left spinning beyblade released atm which is good for competitions. It is meant to steal the opponents spin. Stickers are included to apply yourself. This bey looks incredible, but takes a while to get used to.",2
"Adorable

The socks are adorable-the only thing is the glitter on the bottom was not as bright as the picture. The glitter writing was dull.",2
"Love these! Shoes but not!

Love these! Our son is 4 months old and although he is in the slightly larger size for his age I went ahead and got a bigger size and went with the 12-18 month size. It‚Äôs not like he is using them to walk around so even though they are a little bigger the size works out... then I won‚Äôt have to buy a new pair when he out grows them next month lol. They are like shoes but not. They work out great when he‚Äôs in his exersaucer. It‚Äôs a little chilly out right now so they work out great for the season! I can wait till he starts walking... when that time comes this will probably work out great! The buttons and elastic do great at holding them on his feet",2

"Perfect for home espresso bar

Well packed. Arrived in a nice box suitable for gifting. Look great in my home coffee bar. Unfortunate that people are leaving negative reviews on this product based on the size which is clearly listed in the description. If you are looking for a regular sized coffee mug, this is not what you are after. These are small espresso cups. Don't down vote a product because you ordered it without understanding what you were ordering.",2
"Better size options would be gr8

My hair is about two feet long and I have a pretty big head. A couple of the reviews on here sounded promising that the towel would be able to hold all my hair. Unfortunately, it does not. About 6 inches still hangs out (and even then that's not covering the roots of my hair very well). HOWEVER, it dries my hair REALLY well. Like so well, that the hair that doesn't fit in the towel doesn't bother me once I take all my hair out of the towel. I've only used it twice now, so I can't yet comment on if it is keeping my hair strong, but so far my hair doesn't feel worse. If they ever sell a normal size of this towel I'll definitely buy it.",2

"Best carryon solution I have found

This bag fits nicely under the seat or at your feet in the car. It has multiple pockets for easy access to your phone, water bottle, etc. The interior of the bag holds make-up, medical supplies, books, etc. It's deceivingly ""large"" due to it's configuration and pockets. I am not searching or fumbling for items, therefore, not annoying the person sitting next to me. Best of all it has a built-in strap at the back, so it slides right on top of another suitcase or carry-on.",2

The ‚Äúhard‚Äù side it pretty useless when it comes to brushing my cats (maybe it‚Äôs meant more for long haired cats) but they LOVE the soft side. I use the soft side and another cat brush to brush my cats. It‚Äôs nice to have a brush with a handle to put some distance between them and my hand in case they get annoyed and decide to bite.

Almost perfect. I find when I write, the pen will turn so the ink thingy goes in and disappears. I have to constantly twist it to make it stay. Also, the ink does that thing where it bunches up at the tip as you write so you occasionally have that ink blob in some of your letters. Other than that these are super great pens. I like the weight. They are easy to keep track of. I know instantly if one has been stolen from my desk and where it went (Greg!).",2

I was shocked on how good these are made. For the price they are actually very well made! I gave one as a house warming gift and it was used that night.

"Almost purrrrfect system

Almost purrrrfect system Really great concept. Well designed product. Took several months to train my kitty but he is completely toilet trained. My main complaint is that he needed another step between standing on the ring and the actual seat. The ring is too low down and my cat liked to rest his back paws on there so he never really transitioned to the seat rim. I had to gerry rig all these weird things to elevate his feet and finally get his back paws on the seat. I would recommend that the designers make one last ring that fits over the last that comes flush with the seat so the cat moves on the ring. I love having a toilet trained cat.",2

I also love that I can tie him to a park bench or tree at the park when we‚Äôre ready to take a break from walking. The only gripe I have is that two connections are on one side of the leash while the third is on the opposite side rather than them all being on the same side of the leash. One of those connectors will be rubbing on your back if you‚Äôre using it handsfree like I do, and it can be annoying, but other than that this is the best leash I‚Äôve found by far. It‚Äôs well made and sturdy and the connectors can be used to hold poo bags and hand sanitizer easily and they‚Äôre still large enough to easily clip the leash clips to.",2

Ru Paul‚Äôs stage race all stars season 3 episode 6 ends early. The reviews online all talk about the elimination but the episode here stops just short of the lip sync elimination. Normally I would assume this was on purpose but literally everyone that watched the episode live keeps talking to me about the elimination as well as reviews online are ranting about it. Please fix this.",2
"They work for me

I like these foam inserts. I have a different filter than what these were designed for, but not a problem. These are easy to cut and fit great. They cost much less than the ones sold for my filter. So I'm pleased.",2
"Easily applied and superior protection, touch response excellent

Unlike some who complained about the application, I had no problem getting it on cleanly and strait the first time. And I have a couple of spares now if they become necessary (so far not needed). I've been using the phone for months now and its working great. No scratches even. i'd buy again if necessary, but doesn't seem to be needed as I'm still using the first protector!",2
"Affordable

The headset works well for gaming, has a clear mic, not distorted at all.",2
"Works really well

The product works really well and fits my boyfriend perfectly (got the large size). Only thing is that it takes some playing with to get the flint working and a few strokes to get it sparking, but its small so it will take a few extra strokes.",2
"Good popcorn and family

Classic better than new movie",2
"Great book

I am happy to buy this book. The writer well clarification and ingenious data share in this book. I discovered this book bunches of instruments and how it use. I supposes this is a best reasonable manual for Wicca.",2
"Mystery comes to a small town.

Frank Harper is at the end of his career in law enforcement. He just wants to make peace with his daughter and meet his grandchild. But when two small girls are kidnapped Frank struggles to stay out of the investigation. Interesting characters and plot twists and turns. Could have been a bit shorter as some repetitive descriptions and information. Would read another in the series.",2

"Works great, I Brazilian wax myself and the auto temp ...

Works great, I Brazilian wax myself and the auto temp is really helpful doesn‚Äôt get too hot. When the light is red it means it‚Äôs heating up and when it gets to blue it means it‚Äôs ready to be used. I would like it a tad bit hotter when it‚Äôs on blue because I like a less thicker consistency but it still works great",2
"I love the way it taste

Delicious!! I wish they sold this in the grocery store!! I love the way it taste. Expensive, but good.",2

Not much to say with this product, it works exactly as excpected, the webcam I have has a nice little threaded hole to place it directly ontop of the tripod. Decent quality material, should work for you if you just want a little tripod.",2

Very well made. Not as long as expected for a tunic top but still a nice length for wearing with jeans or work slacks.",2

Great for extra absorbency, especially for night use, and they dry easier/faster than the microfiber.",2
"These green leave strands are in small strands for various ...

These green leave strands are in small strands for various kind of combination. I combined 3 strands for the decoration in the first picture. If you need longer strand, you can combine 2 strands. The strands are very flexible to fold into any shapes.",2
"Awesome.

I like it. Thank you.",2
"Bright

I used these on my GMC Sierra. Cops can definitely not say they can't see your license plate with these. They light it up real good.",2
"Five Stars

Sounds good. I like it!",2
"Perfect bows for young hair!

My youngest daughter is just getting to the point where she can wear bows. I ordered these hoping they'd work for her, and they're AWESOME! The ribbon is really high quality and the alligator clips are perfectly wrapped to both stay in place and not pull her delicate hair. She loves being able to wear bows like her big sister. Each ribbon has two bows so you can wear pigtails! She's so excited and looks adorable in them. I love these bows; if you're on the fence, do it! You won't be sorry!",2
"Sturdy. Stable. Well made. Simple to install.

This is 16 feet in length. I installed it up against a fence using a staple gun. It took less than ten minutes without assistance. This privacy fencing is stable, sturdy, built good and totally worth the money. It arrived quickly, wrapped in plastic inside a tall box. I'm buying another one. I'm very pleased with this purchase!",2
"Very good value for the money

I have no garage to keep my weights covered. During the summer the shade is adequate to keep the sun out of my eyes and a nice cool breeze blowing through my workout area. I have placed anchors in the ground and attached the legs with hose clamps. The joints have been screwed together using self tapping screws. The cover lasts about 3 yrs before replacing the cover only. The frame has a very good powder coating that lasts a long time depending on environment.",2
"Great read.

I wished it was longer. I really liked it. I can't wait to read the others so I can find out how their lives progress.",2

"Best ever

I started reading and couldn't put it down. I questioned, I wondered,I hated , I laughed, and then I cried. This book has every thing. I just love the way you put everything together. This the first love story I've read that I couldn't even eat until the end when I was so happy I cried.",2

Product is great and lightweight; perfect for me because it was bulky.",2
"Great!!

Great for cars always gives the best video recordings when driving",2
"but it still looks good and I‚Äôll have a skirt on over this

Kinda wish I went with a size small instead of a medium, it‚Äôs baggy on the crotch, but it still looks good and I‚Äôll have a skirt on over this.",2

These charms are very cute. Love them. I am using on making my own pet collars.",2

Well, this just feels good and looks good. So simple, but so nice. My sister loved it so much I ordered another one for her!",2
"Great Gloves

They are very comfortable and do actually keep my hands warm without being too thick.",2
"I do like this product

I do like this product, but I thought the brush included would be easy to use for eyebrows, but it won't fit in the opening of the container, so therefore is misleading to send along with this product.",2
"Great tech Gift for musicians

I bought this as a present for my boyfriend. He absolutely loves it. It has a ton of settings for different instruments that you can save for each instrument you have. It tunes the guitar in less than 30 seconds. It's really accurate and also pretty cool. It doesn't tune as well if there's any other music or sound around, so you need to be in a quieter area.",2
"Just doing what you say you will do that's the important thing keeping your word

How to start a game at the right time we're able to get it in a short. Of time then able to get it installed and everything went well and it was exact one that that we wanted and needed and the price is right thank you Amazon",2

Looked beautiful. Covered all the phone. I purchased it in September, it lasted 8 months. Good for the price. The top cover hinged tab broke. Would not stay on.",2
"Driving recorder

I was very happy to receive the goods. It was very good on the grade. It was especially suitable after installation. The picture was clear, the operation was simple and easy to understand. I didn‚Äôt let me down. The last one was not clear. There is no problem with this. Very good, cost-effective is still very high, recommended to buy, all praise service is very thoughtful.",2
"thoroughly read the instructions

So glad that I purchased this. This really helps get any extra off my teeth, to the point where I may increase the length of time for dental cleanings. It feels like I've been to the dentist daily. Love it. It take me a few tries figuring out how to use this without spraying the room, but have it down pat now. :)",2
"Works the best out of all the tempered glasses I've tried

Works the best out of all the tempered glasses I've tried. Covers most of the screen but there is still a gap open to the edge and the edges don't stick completely due to the curve of the screen.",2
"Super quiet,

Love this fan. QUIET. For some reason, some times when I have it plugged it, it cuts off. Don't know why. Then it will be okay. That's why I didn't give 5 stars.",2
"Mobility and price

Very well built. Over 800 pounds riding on them and doesnt change mobility. Great price.",2
"Love the sizes and stand

I was looking for a larger bamboo cutting board and came upon these. Now I have a variety of sizes and the quality of them is super. They wash up like a breeze. I will use the mineral oil when they seem to need it. Very happy with my purchase.",2
"Product works well for an achy back at a fair price!

I purchased these when I could no longer find the Ben Gay medicated patches that I normally buy. They did the job, however they didn't stick quite as well as the Ben Gay. I would buy them again in a minute.",2
"Stylish & comfortable.

Wife loved it. Nice muted colors and it seemed well constructed.",2

Works pretty good. Just a suggestion, use rechargeable batteries. Son loves it soo much I decided rechargeable batteries worked best.",2

This is a solid case for Tab S6. Was very easy to install and gives me feeling that this case will surely protect my Tab S6 at the time of falls and shocks.",2

"Good product a bit expensive but overall i like it.

I've been using the product for about six months, love the fragrances lathers well. I recommend you try it at least once.",2
"It's like a whole new room..

I bought a quilt set instead of a conforter set because it's easier to maintain without having issues with clumping filling and damaging wash cycles. The quality of the quilt is nice but just know that it's a print and not technically a proper quilt. It's black and white, but the patterns do give it a black/gray appearance which is nice. It comes with two pillow cases and I had no issues fitting a standard pillow in them. It also comes with two throw pillows which are of nice quality/material. I've not had the product for long at all but it held together great after I popped everything in the washer/dryer (except the throws of course), and the material feels very durable. I will update this review in the future to reflect durability. The style of the product is what struck me though. It's got a quaint homey look to it whilst also feeling high end and elegant. Overall I'm very happy with this purchase, considering the price. Many products offer a lot less for a lot more. This was well worth it in my opinion.",2
"Helpful

Nearly all the tips useful and. I consider myself an intermediate to advanced user of OneNote. I would highly recommend.",2
"Exactly as advertised

I wanted one for some time ‚Ä¶..very satisfied",2

Love Dallas and Roarke ! I love the death series of books in fact on my second time read through and pre ordered the newest one.",2
"Quality product

Good quality oil. We completely use coconut oil for cooking and we buy in bulk from costco. This time I was looking for smaller bottle to ease to carry during travel and I found this one it‚Äôs Same quality as Costco but in smaller version. Cost is high abit but remaining everything good",2
"Preformed as expected

preformed as expected, I was happy with the quality, price was reasonable although not a ""super"" deal, delivery was as stated, and I would purchase from the seller again.",2

"Eggnog!

I LOVE this eggnog flavoring. I used to buy Keurig Spiced Eggnog k cups and they stopped making them. I began looking for another brand and just couldn‚Äôt find one seasonal or otherwise. I put 4 drops of this on a 10oz cup of freshly made coffee and it is a perfect replacement. Bonus: it is a heck of s lot cheaper than the k cups were too!",2
"As Advertised

This worked just fine - the glittery gold was a bit more 'cheesy-looking' than I expected for a pretty classy retirement party I had planned. But when I paired it with some fake succulent plants, on top of a white iced cake, it looked pretty good. Pay attention to measurements so you aren't surprised by the size.",2
"Nice set for young readers

Son enjoys reading these",2
"Four Stars

Works perfect! I only wish that it came with a cover",2
"Excellent choice!

Perfect!! I was going to try to gather the materials to make this for my grand daughter but once I saw this I was sold. It is made well, seams are sturdy zippers are nice. You couldn't make this item for the amount they sell it for. It was well worth it and will be plenty useful for the kids to sleep on or watch tv.",2
"Great fit, sleek look

I definitely love the look of the case but its a pain to put on. I would definitely suggest to leave this case on as much as possible or the plastic edges that clip it place are sure to break. I love that this case came with a key board cover as I hear these new macbook pro's are prone to keyboard issues, however it will change the way the typing feels so get ready for an adjustment period. Lastly I also appreciate the screen protector however it does cause a ton of glare in dim areas with partial lighting, I know it sounds weird but the brighter the room the better it seems to look as long as the light source is not behind you. Either way you're going to get a lot of glare if you use the screen protector.",2
"Recommend? Yes and no.

Ok. I love these but why do they run out soooo fast?!?! It runs out in 2 days for those of u who write a lot. But overall, its smooth to write and has an eraser too!",2
"Five Stars

Product is what I wanted",2

Shipping was fast and they are perfect. So Cute!",2
"Strong magnet hooks.

I have metal shelving units along the wall in my garage. I use these hooks 2 thread clothesline through and then placed shower curtain hooks tarp grommet holes to make a curtain over the open shelves. It worked perfectly. The shelving units look neater, the contents hidden away until needed. Excellent product",2
"Not a learning toy.

This toy is not really a ""learning"" toy. My daughter has been wanting one for a while so I finally got her one for her birthday and she likes it a lot.",2
"Four Stars

It fits the sofa pretty good",2
"Comfy!!

These boots are quite comfy! I am on my feet for 10 hours a day at work and my feet are happy at the end of the day. I'm thinking about getting another pair in a different color....Definitely would recommend.",2

Absolutely love this book. Every word within uplifts, encourages and motivates me.",2
"Made of very good quality materials and sturdy

It‚Äôs roomy enough for my 8 qt IP and accessories in the upper pocket. Made of very good quality materials and sturdy.",2
"Looks real

Looks pretty close to real. Ordered this as my travel ring. It‚Äôs looks just like my real diamond. My only issue that it‚Äôs a little too big. I haven‚Äôt worn it yet so not sure how it will hold up.",2
"All families have hidden secrets.

I thought it was very good. Moved right along and kept you guessing!",2
"This stuff is great! Doesn‚Äôt sling all over the vehicle after applying ...

Bought this stuff because my dad is OCD about car detailing and swore by it. This stuff is great! Doesn‚Äôt sling all over the vehicle after applying it! I also use it on the plastic tire fender wall and outside plastic and helps keep it from fading in this Florida weather. Definitely would recommend this 10 stars if possible!",2
"Nice

The charger and battery for my macbook pro arrived quickly and performed as expected",2
"...

Great Story although I don't usually read alternative sex play stories this was low key version of one. I do love hearing about the badgers hockey team.",2
"comfy

good sheets for the price",2
"GET THIS PHONE HOLDER

This was such a great purchase for the money. The only reason I‚Äôm giving it 4 starts is because it can get glitchy sometimes and the brackets will open when they‚Äôre not supposed to. On the other hand, the suction is GREAT! This baby will never fall off your air vent. It grips your phone perfectly with the automatic brackets and the touch release feature makes it so easy to remove your phone. It also charges super fast! Love it.",2
"Very warm

Very warm and dry. Will make your hands sweat",2
"nice frame?

I used this frame on an oil painting , so the glass was unnecessary. I noticed, though, that the inner edge is not stained... not a big deal since it matches my painting, but having this area also stained would have been better.",2
"Powder

Works as intended nothing special,good price though",2
"Never thought a device would re-ignite my love of reading by its comfort of use.

Love this kindle! Originally I thought this would be too small to use daily but in the last 10 days I have hardly put it down and as a result I am tearing through my kindle library. Thank goodness for Amazon Prime Kindle Unlimited. This is light weight and easy on the eyes in sunshine or low light.",2
