"Few polished maps, there are about 10 maps but only about 4 or 5 of them are completely done the others are still work in progress maps that have yet to be finished",0
"The game is also incredibly poorly optimized,  I run the game on the lowest possible settings and I only get 45-60fps.",0
 but the server is trash. Crashed a thousand times.,0
This is hands down the worst tutorial I have ever played in my entire life (I still can't believe I actually powered through those 3 hours) and ,0
but nothing is brought back to your own game.,0
"That's the real reason why there's no Steam Workshop for NMS - no-one can build anything worth putting in it, and it'd be ALL bases anyway.",0

If you play permadeath you can literally wind up doing nothing but the tutorial over and over again because you can get killed easily during the tutorial.,0
I also hate that dorms where 100 people live are favourable to single dorm rooms which is the opposite of the real world and took a min to wrap my head around.,0
This has soft locked one of my saves as it now crashes on load up.,0
"So, you googled No Man's Sky and you read all the bad stuff that happened at launch: you think that the game is thrash, fair enough, it used to be this way.",0
the intriguing parts of the story were the surreal sequences and the hints at a larger narrative on the store page and the community hub.,0
"I think that improving the atmosphere would go a long way, adding more dialogue, making the different squad members have personality and banter. So far everything feels muted.",0
 There were some very easy puzzles here and there but mostly it was just clicking and dragging. ,0
the guilt for not having pvp ,0
What a pathetic waste to have billions of planets and not be able to enjoy it with dedicated servers hosting 1000's of players.,0
ruins interaction with other players as it is.,0
I played the new update and it makes me hate this game more than I did the first time I reviewed it.,0
I guess these could be standard for games that use flight stick controllers ,0

"The ROE (rules of engagement) might be annoying and off-putting to those who are not familiar with SWAT or simulation games at first, but ",0
"Your ship and suit used to have three sections: inventory, tech, and protected storage (a few slots protected from you dying). Simple and had the nice feature that you could put tech items in the inventory space as well to trade carrying capacity for more mobility, shields, etc. No need to worry about that choice anymore. Inventory is inventory and tech is tech and protected storage is gone--just like all your stuff if you die.",0
"needs options for aa methods, post process effects (vignette, dof etc.) instead of putting them all under a few sliders and not knowing that they actually enable/disable for what quality setting?",0
I wish it unlocked the whole map or a few campuses with each level completed because I do not know how big the game is and it would help me decide what to focus on.,0
"The differing game modes add some extra flavour and variance, but they still -feel- almost identical. ",0
"with only vague references to actual diseases,",0
"I like the game but I cannot play it until they fix the saving issue, some of the levels do not save progression and I cannot do other missions because of it.",0
"I like the concept of the superbug network and the global initiatives, but I wish there were a way to complete some of the smaller tasks on your own instead of forcing you to have in-game friends help you complete the projects.",0
"It's just lack of engagement, like a rewarding system that will make people play it again and again. Why don't they give some reward if you beat certain map with certain score? That way, people will strive for that S score and keep playing and learning the game. ",0
"Every time I log in to play now the game freezes or crashes. I have done everything I can to fix update drivers, uninstall and then reinstall, lower the settings, and even follow some online guides. None of it has worked so I am forced to permanently uninstall as it has become unplayable for me.",0
"my graphics for this game are set to very low and the frame rate is still a bit poop, ",0
"when you start each hospital, it is fun for about 20 minutes but then the game goes from intermediate to very very hard very quickly as you become overloaded with incurable dying patients, debt that never seems to go away, and everyone wanting to get promoted at the same time",0
"The camera is very disagreeable. Even after tweaking the settings and modding the game, I was not able to play it without feeling nauseous.",0
only downside is no unlocks everything is given to you good for tactical roleplay but not much else,0
" in general the movement of this game is odd, and I def.",0
"Not because it's challenging in a way that makes sense, usually rather because it's erratic and often unrealistic due to some of the core mechanics being pretty awful.",0

"if I do get in the red, it does not take long to start building back up and once you do then you build up fast. ",0
"I participated in the game's ""main"" storyline. It's one of those 'pick your bad ending' plots which isn't really worth putting a spoiler alert on. It really is that forgettable.",0
Hands down the game is really really good although I would really love to see more choices/options for customization to weapons and outfits (things to make your operator stand out) ,0
Some screen on text has such bad contrast and disappears too quickly. Low visibility and useless torch that just faces behind you sometimes or turns off randomly meant I fell down into a cave that seemed to only have the one opening in the ceiling.,0

When has a game is own profanity filter been beat by itself?,0
"Local chat is bad, and it should simply be removed altogether.",0
 there has been a difficulty spike.,0
The crafting system is very unclear and gives little enough guidance to only annoy you. There are just too many innovative solutions that are never explained to the player. Who came up with this save game system that you have to google to understand? ,0
"Other than that, the game lives up to what it was marketed to be. If you do your research before buying this game (or any game) , as you should, you would see the metaphorical small print under where it says ""18 quintillion unique planets"" and that small print says ""procedurally generated"".",0
the devs changed the game and inventory system for people who've played the game for 2 hrs and screwed over long time players.,0
"It was the greatest disappointment I ever faced in a game when it launched in 2016, but now I consider it to be the biggest redemption story in the history of gaming.",0
"I needed 10 hours to get through the tutorial mission because, crashes, corrupted save files and no existing dialogue options.",0
"This whole time, trying to launch the game resulted in the UE4 prerequisites installer opening and hanging at 0% again, needing to do the steam cloud trick to bypass the installer and launch the game to even see if one of my attempted fixes for the FRS setting worked. Then I had to figure out how to bypass the first time setup requirement every single time the game was launched.",0
"I heard my friend who did buy it say he got burnt out on it, and after it is release, I watched a couple people on YouTube reviewing the game, basically saying it was incomplete.",0
"I do not like the new UI, and preferred the style of two point hospital and it had more text buttons which I find easier to recognize than all icons.",0
"There is no support for Joysticks, only gamepads.",0
and multiplayer has a lot of connectivity issues at the moment,0
 that is that it still feels a little bit lonely out in space despite there being a ton of fun NPC's.,0
"It's worth a play through but the endgame is limited, ",0
"I don't know what's changed in recent updates, ",0
"then doing it all over again after it crashes,",0
"The optimisations taken to allow such a vast universe to be rendered are quite apparent though, with obvious texture pop-in, very inconsistent framerates, and limited render distances, which did put a bit of a damper on the experience.",0
At times the game seemed very difficult and it's extremely easy to go down which can result in frustration and ,0
I found it better with friends through discord chat and in-game chat some do not talk or starting having communication issues only hearing one player. ,0
making it so that running and gunning simply does not work in most cases (there's no sprinting either).,0
this might not be the game for you.,0
When I open up a menu the left thumb stick does not work at all. I am supposed to go to the next page with R1 but will only work with R2. I tried to do everything support told me. Change the bindings to custom then back. Uninstall/Reinstall. Tried remapping myself. Tried going into steam controller settings and changing it to the original bindings. Nothing works.,0
"Excuse me, of course, but the gameplay turned out to be voiceless, slow and just boring.",0
"Perhaps a saving mechanic for single player might help with the longer maps, but limit saving to twice or three times to really make players gamble.",0

"It feels good, but sometimes when I shoot through a door and I know someone is behind it I think they are dead, But then it turns out they aren't dead and they eventually kill you, and since you can't respawn in any way, you have to restart mission.",0
"All of my friends and I also have issues with lag/graphics as we don't have very good computers to run the game very well, this game for me runs around 30/60 fps on most maps and sometimes even down to 20 on lowest graphics with AMD fidelity on.",0
"campus, despite the map size, has been completed, something was amissing', oomph maybe?",0
"Fair warning, there was a bit of motion sickness I noted after playing, which was also noted by other players, hopefully this won't affect you.",0
You can do a LOT of different things that very quickly all feel like a chore. ,0
It's very ruff around the edges when it comes to the physics of gravity and other animations.,0
"This isn't so bad, but their AI design especially in sound is what makes them seem too smart.",0
"GREAT amount of bugs. This game should be named ""dumb ways to die because of bugs"".",0

"Polish it up, fix up all of the script/language issues in the questlines and interaction decisions ",1
"And our winnings weren't by luck, we had to learn from our mistakes. One mistake we learned from was to not bring a CoD player with us. You can imagine why.",1
I'm honestly surprised it’s not more popular as a streaming game but that is also whats probably keeping it as entertaining as it is.,1
"This game is a spiritual successor to theme park hospital world, it was a game made by brofrog back in 1973 for the commadore master system 52, it was considered the greatest game ever made, so good in fact that no one in the history of video games, which goes back a long way, (1918 was the first recorded video game that is a fact) has ever tried to recreate it.",1

"in addition, the developers made the game as a platform to sell dlcs through. they have tried hard to make the game relevant through in-game events. this is pretty blatant and might look like they are trying to sell the game piecemeal, however the game does have a lot of base content and is time consuming to play (if only because of grinding) and a few items (albeit thematically wrong otherwise) has been released for free over the years.",1
" ""If this game had SC's flight simulation characteristics IT would be the best damn space sim ever!""

Doesn't work, music will play for around 30 seconds, and then a message appears ""This accessory is not supported by this iPhone"" Spend a bit more money to get the official apple one.",0
"Was not a good fit for me

Couldn’t even get them to fit in my ears comfortably. Very sad, I need to return",0
"With such great reviews, I was hopeful

With such great reviews, I was hopeful, but this is not a good quality DVD player. The screen looks terribly washed out, even after trying to darken and adjust contrast; the volume doesn’t go very loud, so it’s hard to hear in the kitchen (where so usually use my portable player when I’m baking); and it doesn’t save you place on the disc when it powers off, so you have to fast forward to get to your spot. Overall, this is very meh. Returning it to find something better.",0
"Even too loud with ear plugs!

Extremely loud, to the point of having to leave the room and the motor has to run excessively long to fill the tank. Have to wonder how it is even legal. The coiled air hose it too tightly formed to be of any use. Might as well just be a short piece of hose. Had I not left it sitting in the box for months before trying it I would have sent it back.",0
"Filter Failure

Product failure causing low rail pressure, this should not be happening with a fuel filter.",0
"One size does not fit all

The headset is not adjustable, so if you have a larger head or ears, be prepared for squeezing and pinching. I can't speak to any other feature as they were so uncomfortable to wear I never even turned them on.",0
"Not for me yall!

I have this a two star because first of all the quality feels very very cheap and the sound is not that good and I lost it the first day I brought it to school and I don’t regret losing it coz I hate it !!",0
"heart rate off, no step counting

So just got this in the mail, opened it up, charged it for 2 hours. bind it to the phone through the app. Then nothing, it wont track steps, heart rate works for one reading, but one minute it says 93 bpm, the next 48 bpm. I would send it back but would be a waste of time and money to send it back.",0
"Two Stars

Gets moldy and discolored within 6 months.",0
"Nothing Special, Just a Basic Pencil

These are just your basic pencils, no different then the ones you can find at any lottery stand which are available to fill in your ticket. I was looking for a quality pencil with a softer black lead that would write dark and clear. That’s not these.",0
"Ruins when you use with your watch in the water

It's NOT waterproof and will start to ruin the moment you use your watch in the water. If you plan on swimming or bathing with your watch one, I do not recommend this protector. Find one of those glass tempered ones",0
"I actually love this bench but one of the screw holes was ...

I actually love this bench but one of the screw holes was stripped out and doesn’t hold the screw. I used wood glue and so far it’s holding. I hope this bench holds up for a while because I really do love it!",0
"Hella disappointed

Where do I start. To say the book was short is an understatement, you can snap your fingers and the book will be over. Not only is the book short there no ending. She just ends the story in Tony and Virginia and goes back to Benjamin Lee. The very few chapters in the book is and that its. In the summary it talks about Tony story, but yet she manged to put a whole section of Benjamin Lee oppose to finishing out Tony story.Save your money this is an incomplete book.",0
"Not good

Look for another brand I bought 3 for my family and all 3 cracked within a week.",0
"Missing parts.

Not happy with this purchase at all. This zapper did not include the needed AC adapter for charging and the manufacturer's contact information listed on Amazon was incorrect. I was told that they could not help because this was not a Honeywell product.",0
"Falling Apart - Made cheaply

It is falling apart and is made cheaply.",0
"Numb for too long

You will feel numbness until the end of next day.",0
"Breaks off of chain

It's very cute and looks just like the picture but it broke off of the chain after only a few months of use and I didn't jerk it. The fan doesn't have a wall switch and therefore requires the chain to function. It's probably fine if you don't pull the chain very often.",0
"Defect

Half of the letters were torn. Was not able to use.",0
"Never came.

Item never arrived. States delivered but never received it.",0
"NOPE

It arrived March 2, and now it’s May 6 and they no longer work - actually as of about a week ago they no longer work - if you don’t mind only getting a couple months Of wear - go ahead - otherwise , not worth it",0
"Hard to operate

The screen was hard to work. You have to push real hard to operate the keyboard.",0
"Not comfortable

They are not comfortable at all. I have many vionic shoes. Theses are not of the same quality",0
"These are terrible. Like

These are terrible. Like... really, really terrible. even if you luck out and get a pair that don't have defective sound, they're exceptionally cheap, ridiculously uncomfortable, and the Bluetooth literally somehow managed to disconnect my wifi every time I switched them on.",0
"Cheap RCA connectors.

RCA connectors failed after one use. Very cheap.",0
"After only having this product for 2 months my daughter ...

After only having this product for 2 months my daughter is not able to select items, as if it were frozen. We have turned it on and off and gave it a break but nothing. She has not dropped it and no water damage. I was excited for her to have an electronic that would contribute to her learning .",0
"Not what I ordered.

I ordered a Tech 21 clear case for my phone and received some sort of tempered glass piece.",0
"Never received item

Never received the item",0
"Big??? Cheaper more comfortable and their big NOT THESE

Large but tightly made, feels small in shower, too small, too tight to add soap and clean with...put the rest away.. never to be used again.",0
"So so

Not very satisfied with this product",1
"I liked it

Interesting story and semi-detailed descriptions of sweat lodge experiences. The lack of a revenge motive was refreshing. It did seem to be a little juvenile in places but overall an entertaining read.",1
"Not for sensitive skin

Would be ok if my skin wasn’t so sensitive",1
"Nice look to tight for women

I have small head and did not sit well, I used it because it was for custom and did not have time to change.",1
"Cute, but multiple bags needed.

The colors were cute and girly. Perfect for our 1 year old daughter. The balls are not very sturdy. She is able to squeeze them, I make sure not to crush them if I get in the pit with her. 1 bag is definitely not enough. We bought 3 bags of 200 balls and maybe could have even gotten away with one more.",1
"Wrong color

We ordered the pink shirt but it was not the color that was on the listing. We needed a baby pink color for a dance performance and it came as more of a dark pink color. The style and fit were great but we had to return it because it was the wrong color.",1
"Copper Plated

These hooks are only copper plated.",1
"Easy Reading

A nice flowing read with a predictable nature. Likable characters Good for before bed.",1
"It is good for a weekend getaway

It is very big to take to the office. It is good for a weekend getaway.",1
"Three Stars

WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS WESTERN.",1
"Three Stars

It does not fit in the ear well. That makes the product usability. Thanks",1
"easy and efficient

a friend of mine recommended I buy a food saver since I live alone and often have left overs. I used for the first time to package individual chicken breasts it was so user friendly and worked with out a hitch. After using it for a few times it does not suck and seal as well as it once did. I plan on calling the manufacturer soon to see if maybe it is defective. Overall, I would still buy it!",1
"Super cute pattern

I love the pattern but the material on the rugs are pretty thin and get dirty pretty quick, I am scared to wash them for fear the pattern will fade or completely come off. They are really cute to look at though.",1
"This product smells bad

This product smells musty. It is an almost unbearable stench. It has made my Switch smell. So disappointed...Wouldn't buy this one",1
"looks good. works ok

looks good.. but drips.. I don't know if it's the way it's built or what but it is irritating...",1
"Surprised that it has holes in top cover

I bought this to use in an open 14' boat with a 25HP Honda outboard. The two areas where the cables can go in when the top is tightly fastened with the strap should provide adequate ventilation, but there are two dime-sized grids that are directly open to the rain and/or spray from boating, which eventually would fill and flood the battery box. Not sure why this is designed thus, will just have to check it frequently.",1
"So small

These are soooooo small. Not even sure what size I could order just to cover my bum. Sucks because they are very well made. Order up 2 or so sizes.",1
"Battery conductor

The battery conduction point is lose and it has to be really fiddled with to make the little vacuum to work. It doesn't really pick up staples, which is what I really wanted it for. Does an alright job on dust.",1
"3/5

I thought it was okay. Really wanted to see an end fight scene. Hated that they skipped it. Lazy director?",1
"Cute, but not practical

This is the cutest bird feeder I own. However, I'm not sure what it is good for. Most sunflower seeds slip right through the mesh, so most fall on the ground. I suppose you could rig up something that would hang under it so that what spills out would be caught. Of course, there are many birds that will find the spillage on the ground and consume it, so all is not lost. It seems to be well made and since I love ladybug beetles, I find it charming. You can spot it across the yard.",1
"I got this and it worked great for the first 2 months

I got this and it worked great for the first 2 months. Now, if my dog cries even slightly it goes off. If another dog barks, it goes off. Great product when working correctly.",1
"Cute but not very durable.

Not for an active kid. My son had these for less than 2 months and already made holes. Literally can’t wear them in the rain. To be fair, he drags his feet in the cement while riding his toddler car. The bad part was that it didn’t take too long for the holes to show up. Not even a couple days of his rough play and he had made holes in them. They are very well made and super cute. Just not for a kid who’s always playing and dragging around. He’s just 3 y/o and very active.",1
"Not bad

These only lasted one day at my house. Probably from the kids jumping on them but they worked fine. I will try the old school ones next.",1
"they looks very poor

After few washes, they looks very poor",1
"Difficult to read

Just a note to others. The LCD background is black so the numbers do not have a strong contrast making this (me) difficult to read day or night at a glance. Otherwise would have given 4 stars overall. I returned mine...thank you Amazon.",1
"Pay someone to tint your sidelights.

Very hard to apply. Gave us a run for our money to try to adhere to sidelight windows. Was a pain in the tail.",1
"A little short for my liking

I ordered this in navy, and the color is as pretty as I expected. It is made of a lightweight, stretchy material, so it fits a little snuggly around the chest and arms. I like the way it flares out without looking like a maternity dress. However, it is a little too short for my liking. It is just at my fingertips when my arms are down at my sides. I almost sent it back for this reason, but decided to just wear it with thicker leggings. It will look nice with a scarf or a long pendant necklace.",1
"Has to be plugged in to put your phone in it.

Has to be plugged in to put your phone in it. Hubbies phone works ok, mine doesn't charge well if I'm using it for anything like directions",1
"Excellent book

I have followed all your books and have e enjoyed reading them. I'm looking forward to seeing this series continue and waiting for your new series.",1
"Satisfying taste but not strong enough to help with sleeplessness. 😢

The taste is great but I didn’t feel that it caused any sleepiness or deeper sleep. I don’t want to increase the dosage due to the sweet content.",1
"Great to keep you cool

Vacation must have if going to a warm location and you will be out walking in the heat!",2
"Worth every penny

Takes alot of the mess out of greasing fittings. Positive locking works perfect. I Definatly recommend this. Not great in tight places though",2
"Great texture

Great flavor and texture",2
"Five Stars

Seem just fine, good pens as part of it.",2
"As usual works great.

Just changed out my black ink and put this one in. As usual works great.",2
"90% happy

Ok for trimming not so good for shaving",2
"Looks good.. Drilled some extra drain holes

Looks good..Drilled some extra drain holes.",2
"Great Product

Just received and it works as claimed. Price was great too. I highly recommend to anyone that has heavy gas cans that has trouble lifting.",2
"Poor exterior quality

Outside plastics look cheaply made",2
"Pillow case that give you better skin and less hair breakage? Yes, Please!!

I love, love, love this pillow case. I have had it for a few months now and it has held up beautifully. I bought a silk pillow with the intention of the promised improvement to my skin and hair. Though, it hasn’t been a miracle cure for hair breakage, I have noticed an improvement in my skin and hair. It also features a zipper closure, which keeps the pillow case from slipping off. The only set back is that you have to take special care when washing, but it is definitely worth it. I also get extremely hot when I sleep and this pillow case has made sleeping much cooler.",2
"This is a great feature.

I tested with items that I have weights for, and the scale was right each time. I did have to play around a bit to zero out after placing a bowl on the scale. This is a great feature..",2
"Its ok

This sits on a stand I picked it up by the stand and the stand broke",2
"So much fun!

Love this author. Book is an easy but fun read. Make sure you read the entire trilogy.",2
"Great headphone stand

I use this to hold my headphones when I’m not wearing them, and it’s also an interesting conversation piece.",2
"Well made and true to color but does not stand up

This is the perfect size and made very well. It just takes a long time to actually hold a shape after unpacking. It does not stand up as shown which is to be expected with it being packed for shipped. It’s very thick and durable and true to color.",2
"It is confortable

I love it, it is confortable and easy used",2
"Fits perfectly

I love my hat. It seems to be of great quality and it looks really cute.",2
"Super thick and Super Versatile

This wig comes nicely packaged with a wig cap and is super thick; which is crazy considering the price. Such a great deal since it can easily be styled for just about any Harley look.",2
"Great Tongs!

These tongs are amazing! They have a great feel to them and are extremely sturdy! The silicon tips are easy to clean and hold up to high heat with no melting whatsoever. These tongs have a nice weight to them so they are not going to bend when picking up heavier things, such as a heavy pieces of meat. I like that they close and open by pulling/pushing the tab on the end of them. These are well made sturdy tongs and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a nice sturdy well built set of tongs!",2
"Four Stars

5 stars if you put what it is for on the plan when you send it",2
"It is a beautiful die and I will use it

Didn't realize that the cutting edge did not go all the way around. It is a beautiful die and I will use it.",2
"good hold

easy to work with and mold. good lasting hold and a great smell",2
"Good cotton panties

Really comfortable panties, well fitted, i wish we had more color options than just the basics",2
"Great case.

Really like this case. Fits perfect and seems to be of good quality. Perfect for protection whilst still looking clean and classic. Great case.",2
"In a good way.

Fit as expected. Unexpectedly heavy. In a good way.",2
"Adorable!

Very neat for my First Graders but a little hard to use. They don't mind because this stuff is so popular right now. I use it in my spelling center so they can practice using their spelling words and they have had a blast. Gave 4 stars due to a few spots that have a flaw and it's a little hard to flip on one part of it, where the flaws are, but they love it anyway.",2
"Purple is much better in person than pictured

I'm very happy with this bag. I was hesitant to purchase because the purple in the product picture is very saturated, but I gave it a shot based on the review photos. The purple is perfect, much better in person. The bag is small but it holds the cases for my .40 and 380, plus plenty of boxes of ammo. There's a divider in the middle compartment that keeps the ammo boxes in place. There are 4 pockets around the outside that are spacious, and there's plenty of room in one pocket to hide my extra necessities. The bag is well made and I'd highly recommend it to any person looking for color instead of a basic black bag.",2
"A bit small.

Works fine, but the size: A biggish salad for one or 2 small side salads. Really a bit too small for two, whereas the regular size version is a bit too big. I am goldilocks and I can't find a salad spinner sized to suit...",2
"Almost Perfect.

Great! Blu Ray came in good condition. Although I prefer the cardboard packaging like a couple years ago.",2
"Decent

I believe it did work a little but the tablets are hard to intake.",2
