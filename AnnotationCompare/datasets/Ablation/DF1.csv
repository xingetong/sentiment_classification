As much as I’ve replayed the maps so it doesn't get very repetitive.,2

"i have found that the main complaint, pathfinding, can almost always be attributed to poor design/placement of walls/items. by realizing that people form a line at many places, example - reception, and if that line backs into any other line, example - vending machines, or object, examples - radiators/plants, they bug out. this is especially a problem in wards as where you put screens or plaster casters drastically impact how people move through the room.",0

There are other games for such difficult content.  What I always enjoyed about No Man's Sky is that it (and the combat) used to be very accessible for casual gamers.,1
This is probably the best exploration slash survival game out their in general and almost certainly bar none in the sci-fi genre.,2
I prefer you should play with your friends if you have much as you can ,1
I might like this game if you did not need to play through the campaign to unlock sandbox mode which is just a pain,0
Excellent tactical simulation of an alternate universe where police actually use their militarization to stop crimes instead of waiting outside of elementary schools as they're being shot up.,2

only complaint have is the randomness of the symbols and items once had run with tombs and urns but without anything that can destroy them or that synergies with spirits wish symbols and items would be either automatically rigged little towards your synergies could be rigged by the player with luck statistic that other None can increase synergy capsule or different type of rare currency with which you could even possibly choose the symbol you want the next symbols to synergize with,0
This is the most underrated title out there imo.,2

The option just pops up whenever it wants.,0
some could argue it is not high on difficulty though virtual reality paradise players might be exaggerating about all the negatives. difficulty is not high ,0
the game play loop in my honest opinion is not enjoyable. Now I will say I did not play this game extensively only about an hour and a half but in that hour and half I felt pretty solid in my decision to refund it before the two hour time limit.,0
You can't do the campaign with other players/friends ,0

"Some mission prompts give you bad information that will send you on wild goose chases - for example there's a mission that tells you to ask lifeforms ""on your planet"" for information, so you'll run all over your planet looking for answers, until you find an obscure line in the mission log contradicting ALL other instructions and telling you to leave the planet and go to a space station.

"The Weapons fell great, although I would appreciate it if they add more different Weapons, because every AR feels the same and has nearly the same kill time and if they add more customisable weapons, where you can customise everything on your Weapon, that would really fit this game.",0

There's also Creative mode if you want to construct without needing materials and ignore the other hazards and risks.,1

My biggest criticism so far is a lack of simplifying options in the inventory menu's interface (making you have to drag and drop to stacks of similar things in other inventories).,0
 I understand it's an alpha and more content is to come,1
"Another layer that I do not think is shown a lot, are the cooperative initiatives that can be done in the game with other players. simply have some friends with tph, open up the superbug initiative part, and invite them to join you earning in-game rewards.",1

I enjoyed the almost surreal atmosphere (literally and figuratively) of a world so seemingly alive and full of things to do that you could study every single life form and landmass across the surface of the immense planets if you so choose. I'm not one for mindless exploration but there's so much to find and so much that caught my eye that I was baffled.

"Only interaction with multiplayer that currently exists is 'trap bases' for nexus missions, making any with a specific planet waypoint unusable, ",0
Another big one is the voices overlapping each other in the dialog. The dialog isn't a big deal andthat we disconnect from the game for no reason and can hear two of the same voice actors talking over each other.,0
 it is a refreshing start to a reboot which features lots of cool modes and environments on how to play and manage a simulation hospital game. ,2

 I tried hard and long to dig deeper and deeper to find fun in this game. Maybe it is just not for me.,0
There are some weird places and some amazingly beautiful places. You'll find yourself standing overlooking a valley that leads to an ocean with a ringed planet in the sky and the sun(s) setting at the horizon. There's a trade port over there where all sorts of ships are flying in to and out from. There's some weird building guarded by robots that may just have something interesting.,2
my only real criticism is that the map screen at the beginning lags like it has gone out of fashion but after playing for a bit I would completely forget about this.,0
I had attempted to play it on Xbox Live for PC a couple of years ago but ,0

"Since communication is important, ",1
" I put a lot of time into two point hospital and whilst most of the game was great, it was ultimately ruined by two specific mechanics: too many general practitioners visits, and patients walking to the other side of the hospital for a drink and messing up queues. ",0
there is no real risk-reward.- this also goes for staff challenges.,0
"When I reviewed it first, I said I really really liked it but gave a negative review cause of the lies.",0

"it is very much a focused on the puzzles, all of which are solvable either by looking around the area. they tend to be hidden in plain sight most of the time. ",1
I am curious to see how it survives as a multiplayer game as it clearly is focused on good single player mechanics and gameplay.,1
"What I have realized through thinking more about this game is that it is not necessarily bad, but extremely bland. The story is uninspired and shallow.",0
"But I can't play it anymore: the full-screen white flashes during transitory actions (engaging/disengaging pulse engine, finish loading the game, etc. ) turn my eyes into soup and give me migraines within 40 minutes. ",0

 Of course you can cheat a permadeath defeat by the simple method of backing up your permadeath game file before beginning your play session.,2
"The tutorial is so overly complicated, lengthy, and glitchy, that I am on my 3rd run of the game, because the last 2 tutorials soft blocked me. ",0

love the ability to go back to previous hospitals when you level up and even farm earlier hospitals for research and unlocks. ,2
 since there are no public servers.,0
"yes I know it's an early access game and I’m aware that the developer will add some stuff in the future, because I think the stuff that I just mentioned is what I feel like it's lacking from the game and everyone who haven't or might want to play the game should know about this.",1
I've been playing this game on both PS4 and PC.,1
 Spooky mode is awesome during this festive season.,2
Enemies would spawn in and I couldn’t see them or they couldn’t see my enemies. There would be invisible worms and invisible flying enemies.

"if you expected something new or different from two point hospital, then you are setting yourself up for disappointment, if, like me, you expected an improved two point hospital in a university setting, then you should definitely play this game because it is the same gameplay loop as two point hospital but with some much needed quality of life improvements.",1
" the simplified aspects make gameplay much smoother, compared to games like project hospital which can leave you running to a wiki or forums to figure out what device you need to add to what room, in order to treat a given disease. ",2
