deeply addicting random number generator synergy machine that provides streamlined roguelike experience as it stands it is primarily luck based which seems fitting for what this is,2,,,,,,,,,
is because of the pretty extensive background story found on VOID's YouTube channel and mission briefings in-game.,1,,,,,,,,,
"I normally use Nexus, but I really enjoy how streamline mods are when Devs incorporate Workshop support. I cannot recommend Mod IO. I've never dealt with it before, but with the current issues you cannot run your game if you have mods from Mod IO.",0,,,,,,,,,

"they should implement a grouping policy for staff highly trained in a specific speciality, so they always work out of that room...otherwise the micromanaging means you just hire 10x more staff...as you would have a big budget by that point in the game.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The game is mainly third-person with some first person elements to it, ",1,,,,,,,,,
 I would recommend this game for everyone.,2,,,,,,,,,
Lobbies are always populated; the community is very collaborative.,2,,,,,,,,,
"but with no progression there is no motivation to play much more than a few rounds to see everything (side note, there is no 'HK slap' on either the UMP or MP5.",0,,,,,,,,,
played this both on Xbox and on pc. ,1,,,,,,,,,
"The main criticism would be that although the game has many systems, some of them feel comparatively shallow (such as underwater exploration) and the universe can start feeling samey after a long enough time",0,,,,,,,,,
"the ""superbug network"" feature seems pretty cool for people who have friends.it seems to be a shared progress tree that you can invite friends to kinda like how clan progress works in other games but much smaller; ",2,,,,,,,,,
the game got a lot more polished to me,2,,,,,,,,,
the character filters that do exist don not actually work or filter out any useful information. the information overlays do a worse job than they did in tph.,0,,,,,,,,,
I recommended but not fully recommend ,1,,,,,,,,,
"I literally had to put a YouTube video or Netflix show on in the background because I just could not handle the never ending, always sounding the same melody.",0,,,,,,,,,
 Not by any means photo realistic ,0,,,,,,,,,
"The audio is repetitive, same sounds and music’s over and over, and adds nothing to the gameplay.",0,,,,,,,,,
 my friends and I are taking screenshots and sharing them with each other all over the place.,2,,,,,,,,,
I might like this game if you did not need to play through the campaign to unlock sandbox mode which is just a pain,0,,,,,,,,,
I have hundreds of hours logged in this game,2,,,,,,,,,
ome people may like this approach while others might  like Elite.,1,,,,,,,,,

"during the start of the game it was fun, bouncing from location to location discovering new viruses and obtaining new rooms.",2,,,,,,,,,
"on our third mission we forgot to pack flash lights or night vision so we could not find a bag of drugs, the meth heads do a good job hiding there stuff, so next time we know to always bring a flash light.",2,,,,,,,,,
"so hopefully with a few patches and some serious AI tweaking... this could be the game me, 10-david and everyone else has been waiting for.",2,,,,,,,,,
Highly recommended and ,2,,,,,,,,,
you need to use your own imagination to keep it interesting.,0,,,,,,,,,
"though it would be nice if there was a progression system, maybe that's coming. though again, it would be nice if there was a progression system",0,,,,,,,,,
"I'm a little bit disappointed they don't offer native joystick support on the PC, but they do support xbox controllers and",0,,,,,,,,,
I would definitely recommend this game.,2,,,,,,,,,
I really like that it takes so long to get bored so still going,2,,,,,,,,,
 keep the game interesting even if it's on the same map.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Now that public service message is out of the way, I can safety say I love this game it really is a trip down memory lane!",2,,,,,,,,,
even the background story/narrative although only mostly told in text doing same-ish chores over and over again isn't too bad.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Multiplayer on Multiplayer mode your can join with your save, get benefits from your save ",2,,,,,,,,,
this game somehow makes playing a game during a pandemic not depressing and actually quite fun.,2,,,,,,,,,

a cadre of self-entitled kids,0,,,,,,,,,
"and I place it very high among survival games, just below better games like Subnautica and Valheim, but infinitely better than garbage like Rust and Ark.",2,,,,,,,,,
Lots of tongue in cheek humor that keeps the laughs coming while enjoying the gameplay. ,2,,,,,,,,,
just now on the last campus when 2/3 starring the campus I set myself up and walked away from my personal computer and did other things. I came back ever 15 min to reset the year and walked away again. I wish the higher difficulty things were more involved.,0,,,,,,,,,
"If you can handle stressful situations, and the inevitable, innocent lives on your conscience, this game is for you!",2,,,,,,,,,
"That's the real reason why there's no Steam Workshop for NMS - no-one can build anything worth putting in it, and it'd be ALL bases anyway.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The story of the game is rather mediocre. The rest of the story just felt like rather boring sci-fi stuff, with very little twists.",0,,,,,,,,,
This game also makes an effort to remind you you are a police officer and not a soldier.,2,,,,,,,,,
I highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a fun and challenging SWAT game on Steam.,2,,,,,,,,,
 the default visual settings are not great.,0,,,,,,,,,
"I did and this game is that imagined game come to fruition! You will build, mine, create, fly, negotiate and hunt down mysterious signals in the single player mode. If story is not your bag, you can just play creative which has zero story, just play.",2,,,,,,,,,
Keyboard and mouse controls when it comes to flight in the game are clunky but pairs great with a controller.,1,,,,,,,,,
"After numerous delays, this game still offers sub-optimal controls, bad UI",0,,,,,,,,,
my rig is old now and was only mid ranged when I built it 6 years ago. ,0,,,,,,,,,
You can customize where you want your character to have armor,2,,,,,,,,,
"let me tell you. Okay, the idea of managing a hospital is fantastic. ",2,,,,,,,,,
"Graphics - 8/10 - looks great, not photorealistic but it doesn't need to be.",2,,,,,,,,,
"Few polished maps, there are about 10 maps but only about 4 or 5 of them are completely done the others are still work in progress maps that have yet to be finished",0,,,,,,,,,
"The maps are very atmospheric, and for example my favourite, Neon Club, evokes feelings of almost eerie authenticity",2,,,,,,,,,
"personally, I even think 2pc is more challenging than 2ph. Generally I see so much potential with two point games.",2,,,,,,,,,
 I've completed every achievement,2,,,,,,,,,
" it is a sim/tycoon style game, so we do not expect an epic on par with the odyssey here or anything. with that state of mind going in though,",2,,,,,,,,,
" have no idea why but it simply refused to automatically save every time I exited my ship the last hour and I wasn't even aware it was doing that because I just ASSUMED it would operate AS IT ALWAYS DOES, but nope.",0,,,,,,,,,
"If you ever played the game SWAT 4 and liked it,",2,,,,,,,,,
"The AI is similar to that of SWAT 4 and with familiarity,",1,,,,,,,,,
but honestly in every scenario there is something that you can do to be able to prevent death or damage to your character.,1,,,,,,,,,
"I saw this game is trailer two days before it was released on social media, and decided I wanted to play.",2,,,,,,,,,
"l, kinda pricey too even after discount it just do not feel worth it",0,,,,,,,,,
I highly recommend you check out this game especially ,2,,,,,,,,,
"You have no idea what's coming ahead of you and the levels are procedurally generated, meaning if one room was empty during one playthrough, it could contain suspects and/or civilians in the next.",1,,,,,,,,,
"If I had to criticise, I’d say more things to learn would be great (you can learn everything in the skill trees quite quickly),",2,,,,,,,,,
"What I actually do want to talk about is the fact that, whatever the state of the game might have been or might become, I really enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the almost surreal atmosphere (literally and figuratively) of a world so seemingly alive and full of things to do that you could study every single life form and landmass across the surface of the immense planets if you so choose. I'm not one for mindless exploration but there's so much to find and so much that caught my eye that I was baffled. Crashed ships, maps, secrets, mysteries and societies to bargain with and even run for yourself.",2,,,,,,,,,
i must admit to being pleasantly surprised by this game! I am pleased to say that two point campus has yet to serve up any game breaking designs! ,1,,,,,,,,,
lack of motivation to keep going.,0,,,,,,,,,
"this game is so funny, from the weird announcements to the weird patient conditions, you also have plenty to do, ",2,,,,,,,,,
"The story part of the game is no kidding, a VISUAL NOVEL.  Your choices for every mission are ""Yes"" and ""Yes but let me do something first"". There is no deep lore or hidden backstory.",0,,,,,,,,,
the game does a very good job of making each level interesting from the previous level,2,,,,,,,,,
somewhere I could ease the tensions of being a final semester college student,1,,,,,,,,,
"I didn't play early on, so I don't know how bad it was, but given hundreds of games in my Library and I've played PC games since 1994, this one takes the cake.",1,,,,,,,,,
I played for 10 hours when it came out and,1,,,,,,,,,

"like always, I was tempted to play it due to the influence of gaming youtubers, ",2,,,,,,,,,
there is no option to auto send-off patients that you do not have the room to treat. ,0,,,,,,,,,
"Despite the current lack of extended content, there's plenty to do and use, as well as being able to play the incomplete test levels before they're finished.",0,,,,,,,,,
and there is no emotional component beyond a little humor.,0,,,,,,,,,
you'll often have to switch to single player to be able to do missions.,0,,,,,,,,,
"I looked for fixes in the discussion and saw a ""patch"" from the developers for a startup fix. install that. still crashes on startup ",0,,,,,,,,,
";  That being said, it's a blast stacking up on doors and clearing rooms with any friends you decide to bring along.",2,,,,,,,,,
I would say that SWAT 4 had an overall noble tone of being protectors of the people who were going in and trying to save people and make the world better.,2,,,,,,,,,
"it is a bit too easy, thus far; unlike the first original theme hospital, it looks like failing is not really something that is going to happen a lot, the difficulty does not seem to ramp up.",0,,,,,,,,,
the characters interact with things in a much more satisfying way that in two point hospital and I love that their interactions teach them too.,2,,,,,,,,,
I rarely buy games above $40 as such I recommend it when on sale7/10 ,0,,,,,,,,,
It's an extremely detailed tactical SWAT team simulator. ,2,,,,,,,,,
The introduction is painfully terrible and dumps so much info on me that I absorb none of it and I only progress because the game tells me exactly what to do.,0,,,,,,,,,
No Man's Sky is a very true to form depiction of what the Sci-Fi genre was originally all about.,2,,,,,,,,,
"I have restarted multiple ones multiple timed. And still cannot pass them. constantly going negative on the money, getting loans is no help because then you are just paying back loans and never really earning anything.",0,,,,,,,,,
" It was me or them - a split second decision. I am not happy about the destruction I have caused, but I am happy that I have defended myself in a way that neutralised the palpable threat.",2,,,,,,,,,
"There is a variety of maps but with mods you can massively increase that. Mod support is good as well with people being able to make all sorts from uniforms, guns, voices, menu mods etc.",2,,,,,,,,,
"This game took me 2 hours just to connect to friends. We spent the next few hours trying to get the mission log to work because if it didn't freeze, it would go back 2 missions and have you repeat it.",0,,,,,,,,,
"While I initially found the game near unplayable because of the UI, I saw enough promise to come back for another try, ",0,,,,,,,,,
the tutorials and ongoing hints keep you on track and make it easy to play from the very start.,2,,,,,,,,,
"it is a fun game and figuring out how to deal with each new level, tackling every hospital and set of scenarios, is challenging as well as rewarding.",2,,,,,,,,,
"a lovely clean user interface that , user interface is what puts me off a lot of simulators but this game is beautiful.",2,,,,,,,,,

"This game is the prefect bowl moment helper, they say FPS, but this a survivor horror game imo",2,,,,,,,,,
"complex enough where you get to learn how to prioritize, organize and learn ",2,,,,,,,,,
the items in the game should be categorized to facilitate navigation. scrolling items containing 100+ entries and finding item of interest is time consuming and tedious.,0,,,,,,,,,

"Everything dies fast, and when bullets are ripping through walls past your head, or you hear a teammate get pinned down by roaring gunfire on the other side of a hotel, and rush to assist them with a flank- it really gets you into the moment.",2,,,,,,,,,

The story and lore of RoN are not directly presented in the game. And some elements like suspect's uniforms and behaviors are the way they are,1,,,,,,,,,
" I thought this might get boring after a while, but due to various different classes and so many little details to explore throughout the game it has not gotten boring yet.",2,,,,,,,,,
"can be frustrating if you do not manage staff and finances carefully but I have had a blast,",0,,,,,,,,,
" like Battlefield 2042, COD Vanguard, etc.",2,,,,,,,,,
"nowadays its very rare a game catches my attention as much as two point campus has, , and background music/dj that gives some comedy as you play.",2,,,,,,,,,
"the radio in-game is awesome, but I would tend to turn off music and put on the original th soundtrack.",2,,,,,,,,,
"the hospital campuses don not necessarily need multiple stories, two point campus would actually do well with the mechanic.",1,,,,,,,,,
" about 1/4 of the games I play I find that my teammates are muted when they speak, though they can still hear me.",0,,,,,,,,,
"As mentioned, running in the background and playing casually while waiting in a dungeon queue in an massively multiplayer online game or catching up on laundry worked for me.",2,,,,,,,,,
Okay devs I love the game and I wanna see something ,2,,,,,,,,,
 when a shooting actually occurs in a dance club in our world.,2,,,,,,,,,
"I find it to be less addictive than 2ph as it is more around ""decorating rooms and floors"", but they put a lot of work and creative effort for the courses, animations and graphics. All in all: I like the game and I can recommend :)",2,,,,,,,,,
they communicate what they are working on and even release new features after the community asked for them (example: copy+paste rooms). ,2,,,,,,,,,
hopefully not at the cost of IRL currency. Maybe some in game currency and a way to earn it would be cool? along with a shop?,0,,,,,,,,,
"Gun play feels amazing and , firing high powered weapons really gives you that punch feeling especially with ballistics being able to go through walls.",2,,,,,,,,,

Recommendations- -Eventually seeing this game worked into VR would be awesome.,2,,,,,,,,,
 as I love this studio and there is a lot of lovely stuff in the game,2,,,,,,,,,

"if you are looking for the old PlayStation game theme hospital and you have looked everywhere, then stop now, you found it.",2,,,,,,,,,
Planets don't rotate or orbit - stylish for screenshots but it makes planets feel static. Solar systems don't have a real star you can visit; instead it's a 2D skybox that rotates AROUND the planets very visibly. ,0,,,,,,,,,
that's how immersive the game was for me So if you EVER get this game I highly recommend getting into VR with it once you play it in VR you will never want to play the standard non VR: so trust me,2,,,,,,,,,
one of the strengths of two point hospital is its sense of humor.,2,,,,,,,,,
the sound effects of the game are also very creative advantages help make the world feel very much alive ,2,,,,,,,,,
"Can get repetitive sometimes though, since they only have a small selection of maps available.",0,,,,,,,,,

"I purchased this for cross-play as a beforehand, cross-play is unplayable at its current state. From desyncing issues, to loss of data, as in what I assume the ""Main server"" has issue with saving as some progression is reverted to a previous state often after crashes and desyncs. Will review again later if issues are addressed with cross-play in some fashion or form.",0,,,,,,,,,
"""the movies"" was more funny (fantastic to see the resulting film), was more ""natural"" to play (you immediately knew which roles had to be covered by which characters) and could be played in ""casual""-mode (here events are ""pushed"" towards you).all in all I would have liked more a ""port"" of ""the movies"" than this game :(",1,,,,,,,,,

"mentally sane people. Patience is rewarded As you navigate pitch black hallways and rooms armed with nothing but your guns and a flashlight (NVGs are available too), it really can play out like a horror game. ",2,,,,,,,,,
has a bit of a learning curve+ fun easter eggs,2,,,,,,,,,
 but sadly there is no workshop for this game and no online to visit players or helping or trade with other players online so its fun,0,,,,,,,,,

"Looking for a pirate system for instance is impossible, only with luck after moving randomly around the systems",0,,,,,,,,,
 it’s just an open-world sandbox and you need to use your own imagination to keep it interesting.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Yes the game ranks your play-through if you complete the mission, but in terms of some sort of leaderboard there's no real means of competing between other players/teams.

"I found however, that I just built a range of new (but very similar) rooms, and ",0,,,,,,,,,

"I had a very good time playing ready or not, the only major issue was performance, sometimes frames drop when not much is happening in game, usually at 15 to 30, but most of the time I run at 60 fps, but the game itself is very fun and tactical, I recommend Ready Or Not for people with high end rigs because this game is still in early access, so optimization is not the best",0,,,,,,,,,
"Most everything you can land on in NMS is brightly coloured, has weird animals, crazy storms and bizarre plants. Granted, procedural generation makes things seem a bit samey, but there's a lot of surprises that pop up if you're willing to push a little further (the hexagon ""boundary breach"" planet being a personal favourite).",2,,,,,,,,,
"Ready or not has been launched in Chinese, but the Chinese translation is really bad, and some languages still need to be translated by the players themselves.",0,,,,,,,,,

This game brings a mixture of high Tension serious game play with risks for every move you make to also being able to have fun with all riot shields and rams and setting off every trap.,2,,,,,,,,,
I enjoyed the radio and p.a.,2,,,,,,,,,

I would like to see better support for mods and a workshop where mods can be uploaded and shared FREE of charge.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Short list of things that I saw, keep in mind this is a short list just off the top of my head, if I kept a notepad of running issues it would be unbelievably longer:* freighter inventory screen suddenly locks game to 45 FPS or 30 FPS despite vsync off and frame limit off in game settings (never seen this happen in any game, ever)* complete game lockup which required a force close of game and lost all unsaved progress",0,,,,,,,,,
"I really like this game, it's a pretty good looking game, every player has a specific role to fill on the team, the only downside is it's currently just you and your team (ai or real players) vs the ai and , and the hostages tend to run away from you every time.",2,,,,,,,,,
"Although in many ways the game is ambitious and utilises some smart technology, the end product is unfortunately a borked mess,",0,,,,,,,,,
"The game is a lot of fun and it makes the most of the classic ""management"" type of gameplay.",2,,,,,,,,,
Only downside is due to the sheer amount of content the core campaign felt forever and in a way just a 40hr tutorial; ,0,,,,,,,,,

" The last update changed that a little bit, making it less painful to upgrade your inventory, but it's still an incredibly tedious process, the same with your ships, an incredibly tedious and/or expensive process.",0,,,,,,,,,
There is a good variety of maps now; not just massive ones and the house.,2,,,,,,,,,

Just buy it. Incredible... the amount of things you can now do.,2,,,,,,,,,
"this game brings back wonderful memories of theme hospital as it was a fun game to play back in the day, now I am enjoying this one as it has new and weird illness and devices for curing them as well locations that needs certain equipment to counter heat or cold temperatures for example.",2,,,,,,,,,
and the in game audio options are very poor leaving you to use discord.,0,,,,,,,,,
"You can build elaborate bases pretty much anywhere you choose, and in space you can build a base on a freighter ",2,,,,,,,,,

"It's a few maps with bots that have minimal story and no connection to one another, and there's not even that many scenarios. ",0,,,,,,,,,
The only true difficulty in the game is in trying to conquer the unbearable tedium  the only difference is even more added tedium and the newly increased disappointment when dying to one of the many bugs.,0,,,,,,,,,
"maybe I do not know the hotkeys/easier ways to do it, but queue management could be better (when you want to choose a bunch of people to kick out of the hospital). a button to kick or send to treatment while looking at the queue list would be great.",0,,,,,,,,,
My pc meets the recommended requirements exactly with amd cpu and gpu. ,1,,,,,,,,,
"A nice space exploration game nonetheless,",2,,,,,,,,,

"From The Anomaly you can interact with other players, scan their sweet rides, chat it up, purchase upgrades for everything you may need in the deep darkness of space, talk to a space version of Gordon Ramsay and feed him your prepared dishes, and many other things.",2,,,,,,,,,
This game punishes heavily if you make a wrong decision.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Not to mention that the game is actually somewhat difficult, there are times where it can be very easy or just feel like you were unlucky ",1,,,,,,,,,
" Hello Games isn't the first developer to fall for the delusion that they need to ""make things better"" with unpopular and unnecessary changes, so unless a developer thinks said changes are attracting HUGE new audiences, I fail to see the point in making your ""already fans"" hate you!",0,,,,,,,,,
"It felt buggier than hospital. plants not wanting to be in their spot, things always going outside of the room you want to decorate (even if your mouse is on that spot, it flew to a different room). it was a little bit irritating.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Last the only thing I'm not happy with the AI seems so strong I l know a powerful AI maybe bring fun to this game, but I have never seen a AI such powerful, the T without out protection can kill the CT easily. I think it break the balance of the game .",0,,,,,,,,,
but playing it sure makes me want to go back to Keyboard and mouse.,2,,,,,,,,,
" it's proud as itself and should continue in that path for success with providing a rare, intense experience found nowhere else nowadays.",2,,,,,,,,,
it was very easy to learn how to play the game but at the same time some of the challenges have been difficult,2,,,,,,,,,
again this game is not full release yet.,1,,,,,,,,,
" keeps the fighting and movement more grounded & although you can try to play aggressively and rush,",2,,,,,,,,,

""" it is amazing! No Man's Sky also makes me feel alone” which is a good thing. We may be social creatures, but we need time alone: time to think, time to reflect, and time to process our past, present, and future.",2,,,,,,,,,
it forces you to make split second decisions ,2,,,,,,,,,
"I am chewing through the game pretty quickly, and",0,,,,,,,,,
Always feels like playing in hard mode with wall hacking AI,1,,,,,,,,,

"If one employee is having problems and you are notified, you can’t just click on the notification to take care of that person; you must locate them via the staff interface, scrolling through all your employees, with no way to filter/search for the unhappy individual.",0,,,,,,,,,
"In my 6 hours of play as of writing this I have found two: travel to the center of the universe, and essentially go on a pilgrimage to specific ancient space stations scattered around the universe. There’s a lot of flavor text written in first person; it really helps to immerse you when you're facing a gigantic red pulsing sphere telling you to discover the nature of existence. ",2,,,,,,,,,
"it has an original appeal especially with the easter eggs in game, very lively characters that add life to the game",2,,,,,,,,,
since you actually get to unlock achievements and rewards by just spending a few more hours on the game,2,,,,,,,,,
but quickly learned that some rooms need to be built for functionality (learn the specs of items!!).,1,,,,,,,,,
this is one of those tycoon games that you will buy and binge uncontrollably for days/weeks.,2,,,,,,,,,
"i have heard some complaints about pacing, length and bugs",0,,,,,,,,,
"I will note this: the game is pace can feel a little hectic as you are getting used to the controls and going through its tutorial, but you are never punished for little things like people dying because they were given the wrong meds.",0,,,,,,,,,
Once I figured out how to go into first person view (no more clanky 3rd person animations).,1,,,,,,,,,
"I have been able to achieve a admirable framerate at max settings, ",2,,,,,,,,,
"Very very fun game,",2,,,,,,,,,
"in 21st centry, there's yet another game can't turn off head-bobbing. It causes motion sickness,",0,,,,,,,,,
It's had its ups and downs the main problem is the devs fixing things that don't need fixing and the constant dumbing down of the game so new players don't get scared.  ,0,,,,,,,,,
I've already 100%ed the achievements in just 30 minutes!,1,,,,,,,,,
"I won't compare Ready or Not to SWAT4,",1,,,,,,,,,
can only play the game at medium graphics settings.,0,,,,,,,,,

" IN VIRTUAL REALITY is SO AMAZING it took my breath away I couldn't get off my Oculus Rift for weeks, ",2,,,,,,,,,
"This is, hands down, the best game in the open-world space MMO genre.",2,,,,,,,,,
"Games improved like crazy, almost the exact game they promised before, obviously peoples imagination went too crazy on launch. ",2,,,,,,,,,
"Well, since rainbow6 siege has became ""overwatch 1.5"" or as I preferred as ""super heroes Olympic game"", who only like SWAT-type of game or a proper counter terrorist simulator game, ""Ready or Not"" is for you.",2,,,,,,,,,
 it would be super cool if I could use a Scuff controller.,0,,,,,,,,,
it is a great way to have a little fun and explore the possibility of what it is like managing a hospital - and a pile of laughs while you are at it. ,2,,,,,,,,,
 to name my discovered species,1,,,,,,,,,
"the first few levels serve both as tutorials in the short term, but are also replayable, since you can use your unlocks at previous hospitals.",2,,,,,,,,,
"I participated in the game's ""main"" storyline. It's one of those 'pick your bad ending' plots which isn't really worth putting a spoiler alert on. It really is that forgettable.",0,,,,,,,,,
but overall I def recommend this game!,2,,,,,,,,,
i do miss the old diagnosis but being able to change camera angles and the fun treatment rooms.,2,,,,,,,,,
 not because it looks bad but it feels a bit rushed and it makes me worried.,0,,,,,,,,,
Maybe it's just because I aspire to be an astronomer and I love space but I would consider NMS to be my new favourite game.,2,,,,,,,,,
"a artsy skybox that looks like a photoshop filter, and a smattering of asteroids.",0,,,,,,,,,
There are other games for such difficult content.  What I always enjoyed about No Man's Sky is that it (and the combat) used to be very accessible for casual gamers.,1,,,,,,,,,
"The developers brought the game back to life with massive, reputation-changing FREE updates,",2,,,,,,,,,
"Customization of your kit and individual items is really good, letting you create loadouts for different tools and armor setups in addition to guns and ammunition types.",2,,,,,,,,,
"I honestly don't get why so many think this game is amazing and very few negative reviews, I suspect the rarity of these types of game is why. ",0,,,,,,,,,
It's not very fun to fight against AI enemies. ,0,,,,,,,,,
"If you loving managing your base and colonies, ",2,,,,,,,,,
and I cannot recommend it.,0,,,,,,,,,
"AI doing exactly that in a quarter second, which is insane.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Then there is combat which consists of dogfights and on-foot combat. On-foot combat is nothing to write home about but the dogfights are where it gets fun. There's a lot of ship types too, some are meant for storage, some are meant for dogfights, and some are meant for exploration. The dogfights are honestly a lot of fun, especially when you've pissed off an entire species and every time you go in their galaxy they're gunning for you.",2,,,,,,,,,
"This game is great! This is a real ""Spaceman Simulator""!",2,,,,,,,,,
"Stacked up on a door with my group, used the camera to look under the door, saw one guy with a gun, breach in, the guy turned out to be john wick, we restarted.",0,,,,,,,,,
"It creates a culture of excuses, Stockholm syndrome and worst of all; a lack of accountability on the part of developers ESPECIALLY the big AAA studios -see Cyberpunk 2077.",0,,,,,,,,,
really enjoyed all my time spent on it.,2,,,,,,,,,
"So you're often going to feel bored or lonely whilst playing the game. Play this game in a voice call with friends, or watching something in the background to fill the dead air.",0,,,,,,,,,
while the graphics and animations are still comical,2,,,,,,,,,
 except that it keeps popping up comparisons with my friends’ hospitals telling me to try harder. there is no way to turn off this feature.,0,,,,,,,,,
"customisation of rooms seems to be practically endless due to the number of items in each, and the individuality of certain items.",2,,,,,,,,,
"It handles most of it well in my opinion, but it's a almost uncensored and paranoid view in the fictional Los Suenos, obviously based on Los Angeles. Bit of a swat apologists and commenting on ""defund the police"" as well, by preying on our out of control fear of crime. If you want an opposing view, you can read Radley Balko: Rise of the Warrior Cop about the problem of swat teams being used for so many things in America where they aren't often needed or trained well enough to avoid collateral damage.",0,,,,,,,,,

"The soundtrack further enhances the sense of wonder and immersion, guiding players through their intergalactic journey with a beautiful and atmospheric score.",2,,,,,,,,,
hope game have language Vietnamese and help me translate into Vietnamese,1,,,,,,,,,
giving you that addictive sense of accomplishment that fuels the dopamine reward system of the human brain.,2,,,,,,,,,
 with very limited controller configurations,0,,,,,,,,,
Lack of controller support. Most common buttons just don't work on an Xbox controller or what would be typical for an FPS style of a game. Is it supposed to be this slow?,0,,,,,,,,,
I still only recommend this game for 1 player or for a 3-4 group of friends and ,1,,,,,,,,,
"It's frustrating not being able to hit anything because there's no rollback. I have to predict and lead every shot I take, and it's near impossible in maps full of cover. I'd essentially only be able to push in with the shield while he shoots for me.",0,,,,,,,,,
" there is plenty more to do that I did not touch on like hosting events, but I think some stuff should be left for you to discover.",2,,,,,,,,,
The game doesn't hold your hand but the interface and controls are intuitive.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Other than that, Love this game, can play for hours on end. . Really looking forward to the future of this game.",2,,,,,,,,,
Great fun and lots memes to be made in Team kills.,2,,,,,,,,,
 the game still manages to get my curiosity going;,2,,,,,,,,,
"I never played theme hospital (insert boos and hisses here), but I did play sim theme park, another bullfrog title (insert cheers here).",1,,,,,,,,,
" coupled with a serene and atmospheric soundtrack,",2,,,,,,,,,
"the developers fixed the performance issue and all of the other bugs straight away, they also did the communities bidding by doing everything they asked for . Really and amazing game and developer team.",2,,,,,,,,,
I do not regret buying this the moment it came up for pre-order on their website.10/10,2,,,,,,,,,
"such as weird ammo management, like you can reload a weapon with a round chambered and still have JUST the capacity of the mag, and no plus one which... is probably just me nitpicking but it annoys me.",0,,,,,,,,,

except without travelling with a companion you are alone.,0,,,,,,,,,
"I love customizing each individual room set,",2,,,,,,,,,
"This is a well known issue across the community, regardless of the hardware being used to run the game, which I know works with other games just fine,",0,,,,,,,,,
The game entirely is a pretty fun experience ,2,,,,,,,,,
"I really want to like No Man's Sky, but every time they push an update I get a fleeting moment of excitement until I quickly learn they fail to deliver on the basics, ",0,,,,,,,,,
Meanwhile other games of space-exploration genre are not even in the Goldilocks zone while they desperately try to now! ,2,,,,,,,,,
 since there are no public servers.,0,,,,,,,,,
so it would be helpful to add a difficulty setting.,0,,,,,,,,,
 I would say its definitely in my top 10 of simulation games which are by far my favorite.,2,,,,,,,,,
there is no real risk-reward.- this also goes for staff challenges.,0,,,,,,,,,
"had my reservations, but it is actually pretty good! All of the goodness of the original, with extra added details.",2,,,,,,,,,

"SWAT 4 for me was easily the pinnacle in tactical FPS games and RON has taken that spot now,  building off of the concept that existed and refining it for a modern gaming generation.",2,,,,,,,,,
"No Man's Sky also offers a deep and rewarding progression system. Players can upgrade their starships, exosuits, and multi-tools, enhancing their capabilities and enabling them to venture further into the unknown.",2,,,,,,,,,
as you travel along being guided by the tutorial which can feel hand-holdy at times but really is only there to get you started.,0,,,,,,,,,
"For starters I can't seem to connect to any servers to play with other players. The game continues to tell me that the ""server is full"" or that it ""failed to connect to a server"". The one server that I did manage to get into the players were so toxic and just all around not what you would want for a session. It was almost like as if my first time playing was a huge issue to them.",0,,,,,,,,,
only complaint have is the randomness of the symbols and items once had run with tombs and urns but without anything that can destroy them or that synergies with spirits wish symbols and items would be either automatically rigged little towards your synergies could be rigged by the player with luck statistic that other None can increase synergy capsule or different type of rare currency with which you could even possibly choose the symbol you want the next symbols to synergize with,0,,,,,,,,,

"Immersion still feels a bit off with communication with other species, I don't expect this to change though.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Its still in alpha, the game still has a long way to go, but the core is there and already it is a lot of fun.",2,,,,,,,,,
I can spend a long time just taking photos on a planet.,2,,,,,,,,,
I played the crap outta every bullfrog game; theme hospital was the one I preferred.,2,,,,,,,,,
This is a good game. One of the best ever made maybe. ,2,,,,,,,,,

"Equipment controls could be better,",0,,,,,,,,,

"There are no settings within the options outside of VOIP sound level and mic boost. There are different chat settings like local, squad and team, but the issue I have is inconsistent voice levels. ",0,,,,,,,,,

I was collecting Ferrit and the bolder just grew legs and ran off. It was surprizing and funny. I think it is a hidden easter egg.,1,,,,,,,,,
It's low-stress in the sense that it is not competitive ,1,,,,,,,,,
This game is a very worthwhile purchase,2,,,,,,,,,
only dislike is I suck on keyboard. I play on xbox remote.,0,,,,,,,,,
"yes, campus has honestly more content due to the different courses, but hospital was-funnier-more entertaining (radio and announcements)",2,,,,,,,,,

" charming, with great music, is a joy to play.",2,,,,,,,,,
very fun and relaxing game. it is also forgiving with the layout choices you make. You can still reach 3 stars even if you screw up some rooms in your hospital.,2,,,,,,,,,

"Very good graphics, ",2,,,,,,,,,
"i enjoyed it, the puzzles are interesting ",2,,,,,,,,,
"(Mind you the game is of the nature where it can't have checkpoints, so getting this bug at the end of good run straight up destroys all your hard work)",0,,,,,,,,,

giving this game a thumbs down - but only because there is no sideways thumb.- ,0,,,,,,,,,
 my previous issue with there being bit too much focus on just getting lucky occasionally also ,1,,,,,,,,,
I've had this game for a while now and they've added/changed so many things to make the game better with every update. ,2,,,,,,,,,
and it may even hold up to its retail price.,0,,,,,,,,,
with so many good & FREE updates is something ,2,,,,,,,,,
There are some weird places and some amazingly beautiful places. You'll find yourself standing overlooking a valley that leads to an ocean with a ringed planet in the sky and the sun(s) setting at the horizon. There's a trade port over there where all sorts of ships are flying in to and out from. There's some weird building guarded by robots that may just have something interesting.,2,,,,,,,,,
"now this opinion of mine comes with some caveats: I do NOT have formal training or certified experience from any public or private security company, be that enforcing as a police officer, nor have I been in military service, I am but the one guy that loves tactical simulators, I have played the vast majority of them, and I have some theorical knowledge of CQB that I've learned from my own research on the internet for fun / roleplay purposes in these kind of games, and I must admit, that from all the games I have played, applying those basic concepts from the CQB professionals I've heard over the course of time really hits home with this one.",2,,,,,,,,,
"You walk to the same room all over again searching for literally nothing, not fun for me.",0,,,,,,,,,
enough challenge to be interesting but not so much to be frustrating.,2,,,,,,,,,
"They've made efforts to character customization, base-building, vehicles, starships, multitools, exosuit, and multiplayer modes/expeditions and socialization.",1,,,,,,,,,
"curiously, if you own a console and are wondering which is better, it is simply different.",1,,,,,,,,,
"the thing with games like tpc is, you need a little more time than two hours (the refund play time) . in that case, after about seven hours, I can definitely say that there is not for me. Two point campus is nice enough.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Playing it on VR, forgot to shower, forgot to eat.",2,,,,,,,,,
" done all the modes but it’s a weird feeling, you know this game can be, NO should be so much more and it isn’t, it’s a shallow, vain creature that demands your attention, but rewards you with promises and not the satisfaction achievements or advancement of a narrative.",0,,,,,,,,,
 there is no checkpoints in missions.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Nothing about these negative points diminish the overall pleasure of the game - it is cute, fun, quirky, mindlessly relaxing.",2,,,,,,,,,
" it's an absolutely gorgeous game with good gameplay, at least in my opinion.",2,,,,,,,,,
advise getting the game if you only have one other person to play it with ,2,,,,,,,,,
 as I've never seen a 'realistic' shooter in a SWAT setting (Siege was the closest I got).,2,,,,,,,,,
this would be cool and big open maps.,1,,,,,,,,,
"the humor in it is quite original, the voice acting is entertaining, and",2,,,,,,,,,
and there are just about enough mechanics to explore the first 30 hours or so.,2,,,,,,,,,
sad to say it looks like the end of two point hospital dlcs but overall I have no real complaints.,1,,,,,,,,,

"these games are so in-depth with multileveled puzzles, ",2,,,,,,,,,
"you can tell that this is not an English game as they offer private tutoring as ""private tuition"" and as a current college student, it makes me laugh a bit to get notifications stating my students completed their ""tuition session"". all in all, fun game.",2,,,,,,,,,
Profanity filter ruins immersion ,0,,,,,,,,,
"Whether you choose to follow the main storyline, become a galactic trader, , or simply wander the stars in search of the perfect planet to call home, it's a game that invites players to create their own narrative.",2,,,,,,,,,
"game interface tutorial could be better, but the sheer volume of stuff to do is impressive.",0,,,,,,,,,
 The game will put you on edge as tension builds  It can transform from shoot action game into horror at a moments notice,2,,,,,,,,,
"I am a huge fan of the old tactical classics like Rainbow Six and Swat 3 and 4, and ",2,,,,,,,,,
"each hospital location has unique goals, from teaching and training specific educational goals for staff members, to combating a cascade of pandemics and natural disasters, and encouraging creative strategies to reach each goal.",2,,,,,,,,,
"I'd understand if it was a full release game and the playtesting was there to ensure that updates were of proper quality, ",1,,,,,,,,,
RoN has made and balanced it in such a way that is easy to understand and sufficiently consistent.,2,,,,,,,,,
a Space Odyssey and combine the gameplay of Minecraft and Starfox.,2,,,,,,,,,
" I had very few expectations and knowledge about the game other than it being all about exploring strange planets. A few people in my social circle had gotten it, some liked it, some did not, so I got curious and decided to get it.",1,,,,,,,,,
"introducing player-run groups (like guilds that players can make or join and trade or war with other guilds), ",0,,,,,,,,,
environmental destruction is top notch.,2,,,,,,,,,
 This means you should only use lethal force if necessary and are promoted to arrest over killing and find/mark all evidence for a better grade (You can only get a S if you don't kill anyone).,1,,,,,,,,,
"the sound for this game is really good, guns feel nice and punchy also being able to hear the people through the walls preparing for you is a nice touch.",2,,,,,,,,,
 but with a bit of work I’ve managed to create my own profile for my Elite V2 with Steam Input configuration which works very well.,2,,,,,,,,,
you can be rewarded or punished depending on your response.,1,,,,,,,,,
least it is not worth 30 us. ,0,,,,,,,,,
 but I had to spend hours finishing up the rest of the game I never got to because of the repetitiveness.  that would allow players to go in and fix already built but broken or run down hospitals.,0,,,,,,,,,
"buy it! It is sure to give you a great many fun filled hours. The first 6 hospitals won not give you much trouble, but after you will find yourself restarting the hospital level a few times until you have learned the ropes.",2,,,,,,,,,
"The addition of multiplayer functionality allows for cooperative or competitive gameplay, enabling players to explore and interact with others in the vastness of space.",2,,,,,,,,,
"funny radio station, funky music and",2,,,,,,,,,
"From mining valuable minerals to upgrading your ship and equipment, there's always something to do.",2,,,,,,,,,
 in a similar feel to SWAT 4,1,,,,,,,,,
where even your save file gets erased.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The attention to detail from prop placement to lighting makes the game absolutely beautiful! Your guns create smoke when fired, the light bounces off of mirrors and windows, your scopes reflect your surroundings and more!",2,,,,,,,,,
"I've played it since, and I have it on PC, Xbox, PS4, and Switch now.",1,,,,,,,,,
"as an older gamer, who remembers with great affection the original theme hospital, I have to say I am blown away by this.",2,,,,,,,,,
"I was an original fan of ""theme hospital"" which this game is derived from.",2,,,,,,,,,
" I put a lot of time into two point hospital and whilst most of the game was great, it was ultimately ruined by two specific mechanics: too many general practitioners visits, and patients walking to the other side of the hospital for a drink and messing up queues. ",0,,,,,,,,,
"if you want the business management side there is plenty here you can optionally delve into (pricing, loans and so on), but the key is that it is optional.",2,,,,,,,,,
I absolutely cannot wait for the Steam Workshop and proper modding to come so maps and cool overhaul mods are more accessible and one click away rather than manually placing them on the pack folder.,2,,,,,,,,,
"I do wish this mechanic could be built out a bit more, because after a while, base building and taming pets is the only thing left to do, and ",1,,,,,,,,,
"I got this game for my birthday, due to me having it on my Wishlist.",1,,,,,,,,,
without some of the pain points of the original release.,2,,,,,,,,,
The only big issue with it is that there is no difficulty setting whatsoever,0,,,,,,,,,
"Because the game was primarily developed and optimized for PlayStation 4 (which has 8 cores), it needs 8 threads or 8 cores to function properly. ",1,,,,,,,,,
"I understand the hype now, very good game  watch a youtube review and buy it.",2,,,,,,,,,
if that interests you enjoy glad I got this free cuz I would never pay for this crap heck I got it free and still want a refund!,0,,,,,,,,,
"Another layer that I do not think is shown a lot, are the cooperative initiatives that can be done in the game with other players. simply have some friends with tph, open up the superbug initiative part, and invite them to join you earning in-game rewards.",1,,,,,,,0,698,403
 I am nothing but hopeful and eager to see what this dev team brings us.,2,,,,,,,1,271,403
choices for endless replay value.,2,,,,,,,2,994,403
"My favourite part of this game is finding something new and amazing, or finding a new planet with amazing resources, It is like getting to live your dream over and over again in a Groundhog Day, open world environment.",2,,,,,,,,,
"You can customize your operator and if you are playing with AI, then you can customize them as well. Weapons have a good selection of attachments.",2,,,,,,,,,
Now with all these new updates the game is just absolutely amazing!,2,,,,,,,,,
 I really enjoyed exploration (15 or so planets) before all planets were just reskinned versions of old ones.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Even the starting ship, with basic gear, can handle most space threats, including battling several pirates or a full sentinel threat, with relative ease.",0,,,,,,,,,
"It looks really good, there are way more weapons both lethal and non-lethal, andBut none of that matters, because they all play the same",0,,,,,,,,,
 you can map joysticks / hot as setups to a xbox controller so it's workable.,0,,,,,,,,,
there are not any voice-overs on the tutorials.,0,,,,,,,,,
I have some mixed feelings after the free weekend. ,1,,,,,,,,,
"Not knowing what I was doing I left the planet and entered space in my little ship. I was on a planet orbiting a massive black hole. Fear struck down me but I knew I had to set my sights to the planet next to me. I land on this bizarre planet, nothing but ocean. Yet there was a small island, so I landed my ship. I got out and observed my newfound planet. ",2,,,,,,,,,
" It happened after I reported a bug and one mod disagreed with me, locked the post. Later I got the post unlocked, but the same mod muted me from the server.",0,,,,,,,,,
"good game, however the controls for personal computer are a bit hard to use, I could not find a way to delete doors, some of the students got stuck in the doors and blocked the way for others, and I would prefer it if when rearranging rooms, if rooms were unreachable that it would let you move others before resuming the game as it made it impossible to move some rooms with limited space,  even though all I wanted to do was move two rooms to the other side of the hallway. These were the only difficulties I found with the game in the time I played, (and they are honestly quite minor, hardly game breaking) ",0,,,,,,,,,
I bought the whole pack here on steam just to support two point studio.,2,,,,,,,,,
Even navigating the galaxy map is terrible. ,0,,,,,,,,,
"Personally, I have trouble playing games when there's no progression, unlocks, secrets or achievements.",0,,,,,,,,,
"As a HUGE side note for me, it contains nothing morally questionable that would keep me from being able to let my kids play it.",2,,,,,,,,,
Suggestions to make the game better: PVP Modes (4v4 maybe) almost like search and destroy without the 360 no scopes.,1,,,,,,,,,
" ""Survival"" and ""Hardcore"" difficulties exist, but the actual gameplay is unchanged; the only difference is even more added tedium and the newly increased disappointment ",0,,,,,,,,,
It’s a good time killer if you are hooked easily but be aware ,2,,,,,,,,,
"Options include easy creative mode all the way up to sudden death hardcore, ",1,,,,,,,,,
"Obviously, it is a variation on two point hospital which was a variation on good old theme hospital which is, in my opinion, still the best of the bunch.",2,,,,,,,,,
"The optimisations taken to allow such a vast universe to be rendered are quite apparent though, with obvious texture pop-in, very inconsistent framerates, and limited render distances, which did put a bit of a damper on the experience.",0,,,,,,,,,
including adding a sandbox mode and copy and paste rooms,2,,,,,,,,,
"There is also three different species, or at least main ones, that all have their different language, and are more dominant in separate galaxies. These three are the Gek, the Korax (my personal favorite), and the Vy'keen. The Gek are mostly traders and merchants, the Korvax are mostly scientists and mechanics of the sort, and the Vy'keen are mostly meatheaded brutes, not to says there isn't some bright heads in their race.",1,,,,,,,,,
 it is a peaceful way to spend a weekend.,2,,,,,,,,,
cannot switch third/first person with one button ,0,,,,,,,,,
except for NO JOYSTICK SUPPORT!,0,,,,,,,,,
" absolutely has proven itself above and beyond the call of duty for any video game as a leading title in the genre of survival, creative world-building, and space exploration.",2,,,,,,,,,
Can not recommend two point campus highly enough!,2,,,,,,,,,
"tpc has 3 game modes: 1) a campaign mode where you have a specific objective (e.g. modernizing the courses of a campus), and by unlocking the first star of challenges, you will unlock a new campus and each subsequent star beyond the first, will unlock new things (courses, items and events) that you can use in the existing game or any other game you jump into.2) sandbox with various difficulty settings, with the ability to pick the campus.3) challenge mode with specific requirements to earn the most points (e.g. 2023 valentine is day event is to make as many people fall in love as possible within a certain time limit.",1,,,,,,,,,
management gem! Build your own hospital and see how many patients you can kill daily!,2,,,,,,,,,
I really wanted to dislike this game. it is juvenile graphics and styling had me convinced it was going to be drivel ... ,0,,,,,,,,,
Keep in mind I play exclusively KB/M.,1,,,,,,,,,
"Find your perfect planet, build your perfect base/home and ",1,,,,,,,,,
 but the dj commentary and the ability to add your own music tracks definitely help make this game better. ,2,,,,,,,,,
", imagine. previously, you could see your whole inventory, now, it’s a tiny f-ing rectangle at the bottom of the screen and now you have to scroll wheel to see your inventory. you'd get used to seeing Everything, but suddenly it’s a tiny box a quarter of the size of what it once was, ",0,,,,,,,,,
 some of the mouse-over icons do not have tooltips while others do.,0,,,,,,,,,
"I would really appreciate filters in video settings. I use Geforce experience to turn it B&W, add some grain and letterbox.. . I think if they added that touch along with other filters it would be an amazing experience. I would ideally like a B&W experience with red blood.",0,,,,,,,,,
"i put dozens of hours into this game on Xbox game pass for pc, ",2,,,,,,,,,
"matches can also be impossible to find at times with the ""servers are full"" message popping up 90% of the time.",0,,,,,,,,,
10/10 I really recommend this game so yea give it a shot!,2,,,,,,,,,
"The moment to moment game-play is super suspenseful, and you NEVER know who is armed or not and ",1,,,,,,,,,
the developer is twisted sense of humor adds to the games enjoyment.,2,,,,,,,,,
 but without any competitive play,0,,,,,,,,,
LOVED this game until the 4.0 update.  They did add a patch so I could turn it off. No this shouldn't even be in the game as an option.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Fun experience overall, greatly enhanced by playing with friends and the shared incompetence.",2,,,,,,,,,
Sometimes I can switch to 3rd person and sometime I just can't! ,0,,,,,,,,,
" where you can customize your loadout and your weapons,",2,,,,,,,,,
this still in early acsess is crazy ,2,,,,,,,,,
I believe this will be a super solid game in its official release form.,2,,,,,,,,,
"anyway, this game caught my attention because I have never played hospital tycoon and everyone told you how fun it was.",1,,,,,,,,,
but it's a lot better than it was on release.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Big learning Curve, boring don't understand it and not sure I care to learn cuz again u just wonder around gathering stuff and reading to learn the ™¥™¥™¥™¥ and there are many many things to learn so half grind, half book, half novel, no story, a building simulator with no action ",0,,,,,,,,,
i have played some of the rooms for about 3 hours and I am still seeing new animations which is really nice. ,1,,,,,,,,,
"As a returning player who preordered this back then, I can wholeheartedly say",1,,,,,,,,,
the game is great  and I hope they make it workshop and online,2,,,,,,,,,
"Performance It should be stated that at the time of this review, however despite that fact, the only performance bugs , are either 1 minute long freezes on loading in or out of a level, or 3-4 stutters at the beginning of the first 2-3 rounds of a session.",0,,,,,,,,,
"There is a story to follow about an alien civ which is interesting and then there is the mysterious ""center of the universe"".",2,,,,,,,,,
I got a town and now I love this game,2,,,,,,,,,
I still rate this as 'recommended' because it is very cool in many ways and I think other players would enjoy it.,2,,,,,,,,,
"It has been sometime now and  there has been a lot of updates,",2,,,,,,,,,
There's so much they could do with random events and have creatures interact with your base or just any kind of interactivity aside from the NPC's you put in place. Subnautica's bases feel substantial while NMS bases feel like an after thought. but it doesn't really do too much,0,,,,,,,,,
"which is a game that you can leave running while you are doing other stuff and come back to (see also things like civilization, ftl).",0,,,,,,,,,
"also there is a fun Facebook group to join as well that is fan ran and creates fun challenges and an open, friendly environment to discuss strategies, stories and get help with anything!",2,,,,,,,,,
have to say that this game doesn't pull punches on difficulty.,1,,,,,,,,,
quick reactions and good planning are vital to survival in this fast (or slow) paced game.,1,,,,,,,,,
My biggest wish for this game is to be open for content modding.,0,,,,,,,,,
Game is pretty cool and all,2,,,,,,,,,
Very relaxing you can play for hours without even noticing,2,,,,,,,,,
 You can get such crazy things like jetpack that emits rainbows or some badass bounty hunter helmet for your character.,2,,,,,,,,,
You can tackle an objective in so many different ways which allows you to replay the same mission over and over again and still feel fresh and exciting.,2,,,,,,,,,
"but beware, if you make them wear gas masks or ballistic face shields, their voice will be muffled, so it's harder to hear their feedback.",1,,,,,,,,,
 there is enough to keep you busy for the duration learning about how things work.,2,,,,,,,,,
"staff happiness also does not seem to make any real difference, and there is no threats to leave if you never give them a payrise. The students are also, frankly, idiots.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Ship can't change weapons, can't lock on to enemy ships, the multitool doesn't work, and ",0,,,,,,,,,
" If you dig the SWAT slow and methodical, domination threw teamwork and gadgetry, ",2,,,,,,,,,
"The result is a game that has fun, satisfying gameplay and a story that fully and completely hooked me. It was mysterious, it was engaging, it was emotional, and it was heartfelt.",2,,,,,,,,,
"No Man's Sky is the ultimate virtual vacation destination. Imagine a place where you can explore endless planets, fly through space, and discover new life forms without ever having to worry about pesky things like gravity or oxygen.  And the sense of discovery is unmatched.",2,,,,,,,,,
"Game has very limited info. For example, most objects just say ""reduces thirst"" with no indication of how much.",0,,,,,,,,,
runs really well without performance problems and ,2,,,,,,,,,
this game should be the next on your Wishlist.,2,,,,,,,,,
" These tasks are great ways to learn how to explore the galaxy and teach you what to look for when you want a specific item. Completing these missions rewards you with Quicksilver, a currency used for purchasing cosmetic items in The Anomaly's Quicksilver store.",1,,,,,,,,,
"No Newtonian physics, no drifting, ",0,,,,,,,,,
"Slow, methodical and oppressive, with high lethality and many dangers behind every corner. ",2,,,,,,,,,

"Profanity continues on. The occasional ""F"" word, and thankfully not much else.",2,,,,,,,,,
"I played it on xbox on game pass, enjoyed it so much ",2,,,,,,,,,
It is much better suited to mouse play with enough changes that it is not the same. ,2,,,,,,,,,
 sometimes even make you feel just a little bit for the people you're arresting.,2,,,,,,,,,
"The vehicle and ground combat is fun, this would be so much fun. I am flabbergasted at games that have a boost functionality and do not take advantage of implementing the exceptional combat system of an ancient game called Amored Core. . Even if they fixed the ground combat, you rarely ever use it.",0,,,,,,,,,
Stopped playing it after the inventory UI update ,0,,,,,,,,,
This game is schizophrenic. It has no idea what it's doing and all the voices in its head are just pulling in different directions. It does nothing well and everything poorly.,0,,,,,,,,,
I really enjoyed the 5+ actual hours,2,,,,,,,,,
I still think this is a fun game for people that are in to Law Enforcement Games and also have a group of friends you would want to play it with.,2,,,,,,,,,
"survival mode taking away everything you have when you die and offering no storage system until late game, outside you and your ship which if you die in on foot you lose you inventory o",1,,,,,,,,,
the tutorial did not explain a lot of features so that was very confusing.,0,,,,,,,,,
 but the finer textures tend to pop or straight up use the lowest res version in some cases (usually npc faces),0,,,,,,,,,
requiring a save editor to get out of... which he can’t do because he’s on console.,0,,,,,,,,,
I remember playing theme hospital as a kid. this is the spiritual successor. ,2,,,,,,,,,
Great game ,2,,,,,,,,,
 asking for a refund. ,0,,,,,,,,,
The system requirement of a Core i3 is nonsense. I know of no Core i3 or similar low-spec AMD CPU that has 8 threads available.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Pretty Fun Game so far, played a few hours with my bro, had a good time, ",2,,,,,,,,,
"This isn't surprising given the scope of the game and the fact that it's developed by a very small team,",1,,,,,,,,,
"First, I did not preorder the game, nor did I pay a lot of attention to it while it was in development, therefore, I do not have that feeling of having been cheated that some other reviewers seem to have.",1,,,,,,,,,
a very clever and very thought out game.,2,,,,,,,,,
"A funny detail: I was basically told to just get lost and download mods if I want a better, deeper experience. But guess what: NMS doesn't support mods per-se. The Steam workshop isn't supported. If you want to mod the game, you'll have to find external sources.",0,,,,,,,,,

"Explore where you want and rename your discoveries, I discovered a system where ",1,,,,,,,,,

in beta matchmaking is completely random and hopefully you would be able to filter for servers with mics and certain level of experience,1,,,,,,,,,
I found it better with friends through discord chat and in-game chat some do not talk or starting having communication issues only hearing one player. ,0,,,,,,,,,
needs a progression system. don’t care if cops do not have progression systems irl I want it in the game to reward my progress u larping noobs,0,,,,,,,,,
the Bing Chilling John Xina meme/easter egg in the game files is best,2,,,,,,,,,
as a big fan of theme hospital this was an instant purchase for me.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Your honour, it was a self-defence situation. If I did not shoot that unarmed civilian, I would have been killed.",2,,,,,,,,,
Skip this game. The only thing positive that could possibly come out of this horrible mess of broken promises is the DEATH OF THE PRE-ORDER CULTURE.,0,,,,,,,,,

" tackling epidemics, to handling the balance of budget  ",1,,,,,,,,,
mapping 3/5 there are different hospitals you can participate in that have different layouts/building styles.,2,,,,,,,,,
Not 1 issue with gameplay to indicate any potential problems just BOOM it's all gone my units my mining efforts my fleet all my saved loot all of it. The worst part Steam cloud did not even save any portion of it.,0,,,,,,,,,
 immersive (though flawed) sound design.,0,,,,,,,,,
"This may be a different take, management of gear to how the AI react to improve this game; but that's just a suggestion.",1,,,,,,,,,
A very challenging tactical shooter,2,,,,,,,,,
"The AI is clever and challenging, making it difficult to predict where the seeker will go next.",2,,,,,,,,,
I turned everything to the highest settings and hopped in creative. ,1,,,,,,,,,
strangely shaped buildings to cram all of the requirements of a hospital into.,1,,,,,,,,,
 a virtual 2D screen in front of your face and calling it VR for all on foot gameplay you will probably feel more at home in this game. ,2,,,,,,,,,
I wish it unlocked the whole map or a few campuses with each level completed because I do not know how big the game is and it would help me decide what to focus on.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The reprojection & stutter is insane , on even the lowest settings.",0,,,,,,,,,

Really liked adrenaline rush in situations where situations can go from 0 to 100 in mere seconds (e. g. suspects rushing out of door that I was pie-ing),2,,,,,,,,,
"but more so because what characters there are are extremely one dimensional and uninteresting. It would also be nice to see a human face, to be honest, as well as some actual voices from characters.",0,,,,,,,,,
"to be honest, two point hospital is a game which allow you to contact some medical things about diagnosing novel patients and construct a fantastic hospital.",1,,,,,,,,,
the scenarios are  fun and a bit challenging.,2,,,,,,,,,
once again easy enough to casually play.,2,,,,,,,,,
 there is no customization in the game.,0,,,,,,,,,
as trolls will gladly make them inaccessible.,0,,,,,,,,,
good game with a lot of potential ,2,,,,,,,,,
 plus with the steam integration you get to compare with your friends.,2,,,,,,,,,
room creation and object placement is done on a grid layout ,2,,,,,,,,,
"the game starts out easy, almost too easy. difficulty does ramp up, sometimes too fast.",0,,,,,,,,,

narrative (9/10) -two point does a lot of world-building and storytelling through the radio like I had mentioned earlier. you will find yourself looking around the map later in the game and recognizing places based on things you have heard on the radio or visitors you have had at your hospitals. I think this is a great narrative design for this kind of game and it honestly surprised me a little.,2,,,,,,,,,
there is no good reason for me to be getting a steady 11-20 fps on this game with that equipment.,0,,,,,,,,,

"I have spent days just trying to gather resources to fuel my ship, but the game keeps directing me to build this one device that I can build with the resource, but it just doesn't let me do so. There's no dialogue or indication as to why I can't.",0,,,,,,,,,
"At launch it was sorely lacking, ",0,,,,,,,,,
"it is a lot of fun, and keeps you going for hours with the story progression. All the small and funny details are a must and make the game even more enjoyable.",2,,,,,,,,,
with air/space combat and a storyline that slowly unfolds itself ,2,,,,,,,,,
but I loved playing with random people helping the new players learn the game and ,2,,,,,,,,,
The multiplayer aspect in particular is very unreliable ,0,,,,,,,,,
so a good blend of being able to play quickly but still having a learning curve down the road.,2,,,,,,,,,
"This game just has everything,",2,,,,,,,,,
"The blood/gore effects leave much to be desired (bullet wounds look like actual paintballs hit the bodies), ragdoll physics are janky, ",0,,,,,,,,,
"There is not a lot of PVP and the PVE aspect is very limited, I will not say I have encountered much action in this game yet the many battles I've fought with space pirates didn't last very long and the combat missions",0,,,,,,,,,
"Some mission prompts give you bad information that will send you on wild goose chases - for example there's a mission that tells you to ask lifeforms ""on your planet"" for information, so you'll run all over your planet looking for answers, until you find an obscure line in the mission log contradicting ALL other instructions and telling you to leave the planet and go to a space station. ",0,,,,,,,,,
"Story is sparse and cryptic but has some interesting elements. Not enough to justify playing the game for story, but it can make normally mundane missions slightly more interesting, with a decently short main story and branching infinite side missions.",2,,,,,,,,,
This game is a procedurally generated walking/grinding simulator. Walking and grinding are 99% of this,0,,,,,,,,,
" the vibration from first person view makes me feel really sick, and this is why I don't play it that much anymore.",0,,,,,,,,,
"It feels good, but sometimes when I shoot through a door and I know someone is behind it I think they are dead, But then it turns out they aren't dead and they eventually kill you, and since you can't respawn in any way, you have to restart mission.",0,,,,,,,,,
I'm honestly surprised it’s not more popular as a streaming game but that is also whats probably keeping it as entertaining as it is.,1,,,,,,,,,
"I actually fell asleep one time, while playing. Two point hospital starts you off with a budget of $200,000",0,,,,,,,,,
"Game worked fine for a while, absolutely loved it. One day it kept crashing and has not worked since then.  Checked all files, deleted the entire game and folders and still no luck. Its a shame.",0,,,,,,,,,
"better value in exploration (besides a couple types of ore and weather patterns, most planets offer the same stuff just slightly repackaged), and other types of extrinsic motivators could really help the flow of gameplay.",0,,,,,,,,,
"every time I open my inventory, there's a very very loud and constant buzzing noise that plays,",0,,,,,,,,,
"Spent nearly 1500 hours in game,",1,,,,,,,,,
"Even the achievements for the game are essentially ""wait a long time on a planet"" and ""travel X number of lightyears"" and ""talk to X number of aliens”. ",0,,,,,,,,,
" like walking around the outside edges of the map to get to a piece of litter in the middle, then back to outside edges to get back to the building.",1,,,,,,,,,
"As a person who preordered the game, it's been a rollercoaster getting here.",1,,,,,,,,,
"This game does it's best to emulate real life with a number of mechanics, including slower tactical pace, civilian commentary, the opportunity to make an arrest instead of killing someone, the possibility of a suspect pulling out a weapon or running at you before an arrest can be made, and",2,,,,,,,,,
Have a few hundred hours invested on console,2,,,,,,,,,
"I played titles such as Zero Hour and Ground Branch, but this game is far beyond any tactical shooter I have played (not considering SWAT 4).",2,,,,,,,,,
A bit of a learning curve at first but once you get the hang of it it is great.,2,,,,,,,,,
There are also multiplayer missions that can be initiated from The Anomaly where other players in the hub can join you and embark on a journey to a distant star system to complete a simple task.,2,,,,,,,,,
I played it when I had my xbox and I buy it again ,1,,,,,,,,,

"have only encountered one glitch so far where a patient got ""stuck"" on a building, and no matter how I moved things away from him he would not unstick. after nearly three years in my hospital he is still standing there complaining.",0,,,,,,,,,
love the game... I like to take things easy and build up and tpc lets you do that. no steep learning curve etc.,2,,,,,,,,,
Some screen on text has such bad contrast and disappears too quickly. Low visibility and useless torch that just faces behind you sometimes or turns off randomly meant I fell down into a cave that seemed to only have the one opening in the ceiling.,0,,,,,,,,,
"As the ship lifted off the ground, I could feel the weightlessness of space wash over me. ",2,,,,,,,,,
 A full VR game with the same physics and cross play with desktop players would just be amazing.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Really immersive, dark, and has zero filter with what nasty happens in the real world.",2,,,,,,,,,
 lots of cute funny characters and hilarious two point radio announcers chatting in the background,2,,,,,,,,,
"This ""upgrade"" was worth",2,,,,,,,,,
 it is pressing either a text option or a random monument on the procedurally generated planet.,0,,,,,,,,,
What a pathetic waste to have billions of planets and not be able to enjoy it with dedicated servers hosting 1000's of players.,0,,,,,,,,,
"i have completed all levels and unlocked all content, and ",2,,,,,,,,,
"There is a powerful photo mode, and at almost any time during the game you could open the photo mode and take a really nice picture with minimal effort.",2,,,,,,,,,
A progression system would also be desirable since at the moment you only enter a level to improve the score or improve the time required and these become a bit one-sided.,0,,,,,,,,,
", but who really cares if players were generating BILLIONS of credits selling minerals? It's not like those credits even mattered in this game!",0,,,,,,,,,
"The second the game loads up your new world you're thrown into an extremely hazardous alien planet with extremely high temperatures and you have absolutely no idea what's happening. You get several warnings that your equipment is running low and that you're about to die, and ",0,,,,,,,,,
"The gameplay has depth, atmosphere",2,,,,,,,,,
the satisfaction of winning as a hider or successfully eliminating all the hiders as the seeker is unmatched.,2,,,,,,,,,
"There is a very few games these days, that would keep me playing through all of my free time, and absorb me to the point, where a few hours feels like a mere minutes. No Man's Sky is one of them.",2,,,,,,,,,
"2ph feels a bit prison architect-ish, and pa is a fav of mine.",2,,,,,,,,,

"I think that in time this game will gain some popularity on streaming sites such as twitch and YouTube and will become massive.""",2,,,,,,,,,
"You also can have your teammates' head camera on your display, so you know how's their entry going, ",1,,,,,,,,,
I love the game but the one downside about it is that every time they patch their game its 20 gigs and I have to make room for the game just to update. as much as I like this game ido notwant this to be the only game I play on my steamdeck so I just uninstalled it.,0,,,,,,,,,

"i have not completed the game yet but I have played it for a good amount of time, ",2,,,,,,,,,
"my biggest gripe with the game is the fact that you are encouraged to reorganize your hospitals to make them work better after you have unlocked better facilities, but actually starting over is not a very fun experience. The game throws you back into the same tutorial and generic objectives that you already completed on that specific level.",0,,,,,,,,,
" it favors people who try to coordinate with their team mates (or if you play solo, commanding the bots as well as possible) to take down the bad guys & save as many people as possible.",2,,,,,,,,,
"this game is super addicting and a whole lot of silly fun. the diseases, especially, will make you at least smack your forehead, if not straight-up laugh out loud.",2,,,,,,,,,
There is not key explaining what colors mean or symbols or the letter number combinations for planets (E6pf).,0,,,,,,,,,
"Besides, the game brings a good atmosphere in missions to players. Sometimes makes you breath rapidly  ",2,,,,,,,,,
it's still a challenge to survive sometimes.,2,,,,,,,,,
New upgrade looks promising.,2,,,,,,,,,
and your AI companions are reasonable competent if issued the correct orders.,2,,,,,,,,,
"I tried to get a refund, but as I already spent 4 hours in it, I can't have my money back; $40 I regret spending.",0,,,,,,,,,
 it also crash sometimes.,0,,,,,,,,,
"hilarious themes explored, keeps one entertained, ",2,,,,,,,,,
it is pleasant but it does not beckon for me to play it more.,0,,,,,,,,,
Be warned it is a difficult game,1,,,,,,,,,
 it is difficult to turn items to face the way you want.,0,,,,,,,,,
if you are looking for a micromanagement game with a lot of depth to the operation of the scenarios this game may not satisfy as well as some others,2,,,,,,,,,
the single player can be a fun way to learn the game ,2,,,,,,,,,
but I wish there was some type of incentive like cosmetics or further missions to unlock so I was more motivated to play.,0,,,,,,,,,
"With bot it is reasonable, since they perform many actions automatically. Send them ahead and they will do their tasks with the ""utmost knowledge"" of the situation. ",1,,,,,,,,,

 I cannot wait to share it with my friends.,2,,,,,,,,,
" In a noisy night club of multiple loud sounds, they can perfectly hear when a door clicks open and are alerted. Surround Sound cues for them like footsteps seem bad and can seem like the very next room and yet be three rooms away.",0,,,,,,,,,
the game is so colorful and dynamic. and the different alien types are fun.,2,,,,,,,,,
"I played this game at launch had some fun, and I picked it up again with my wife a few years ago.",2,,,,,,,,,
"This may be nit-picking but another issue at this present time is when you are in the command room before you start a mission and you go to customize a weapon for example. It doesn't cut away from your characters POV, it keeps it and it can make customizing guns difficult and ",0,,,,,,,,,
i had this game on game pass on xbox and was obsessed with this game so I bought it on my laptop,2,,,,,,,,,
"If you open a door without proper preparation, you can easily being instant killed with enemy shotguns or explosive traps.",0,,,,,,,,,
if you're not playing with your friend sometime it's not worth playing with stranger    A. you run into kids or immature who will kill civilian and all lowlife. They're the type of people you do not want to be a cop in your local community   B. Randomly loses connection with server during a match- AI team member will get stuck in some corner of a building,0,,,,,,,,,
the game is overall good and unique ,2,,,,,,,,,
"The much touted variety of planets is... limited. 18 quintillion different planets, and they all have the same gravity. Is your planet toxic, frozen, or desert? I can tell you what background assets will be in use on each!",0,,,,,,,,,

weather it is a save file or a new game.,0,,,,,,,,,
"Also a hint from my experience, make use of the biggest loan you can as you can easily get overwhelmed if you don not build enough quickly enough.",1,,,,,,,,,
so it gets a little repetitive hearing them make a remark every time you tie them up.,0,,,,,,,,,

Too many people play without headset/voice com ,0,,,,,,,,,
"another amazing game from two point, ",2,,,,,,,,,
I had this game on my Wishlist since it was a PvP alpha.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Most games that use VOIP suffer similar issues so I tend to stick to discord or other VC platforms, but this game seems to vary from whispers to screams when it comes to other player's voice levels. this might just be more of My experience than anything, but If you are trying to toss a nade into a room you peeked open, Good luck.",0,,,,,,,,,
"You are forced to play slowly and methodically, which is not necessarily a bad thing",1,,,,,,,,,
"The team at Hello Games saved their reputation a few years ago when, despite the onslaught of negativity from fans, the press and observers alike, they committed themselves to deliver everything they had promised without charging for DLC.",2,,,,,,,,,
the game play loop in my honest opinion is not enjoyable. Now I will say I did not play this game extensively only about an hour and a half but in that hour and half I felt pretty solid in my decision to refund it before the two hour time limit.,0,,,,,,,,,
but two point hospital has a strategy that has depth and fun rarely found over long lengths of time.,2,,,,,,,,,
"I enjoy the core loop, visually pleasing, misses potential for faction space conflicts.",2,,,,,,,,,
" There is no hero trying to save the damn world, no action scenes with stupid QTEs, no .",2,,,,,,,,,
"You will be rewarded for methodical teamwork, but punished for rushing or lazily going through the motions.",1,,,,,,,,,
there are some minor bugs,0,,,,,,,,,
especially with friends to explore the galaxy and complete missions with.,2,,,,,,,,,
"The landscaping tool needs some serious rework, as even through using it on such a large area breaks the physics engine and creates ghostly walls that you can't walk through or destroy.",1,,,,,,,,,
but at bare minimum I have high respect for the developers for retaining their credibility through actions and not photo shopping a PR statement when making a huge mistake which seems to be the norm nowadays.,2,,,,,,,,,
"unfortunately, you sometimes get matched with players who want to rush and then they get killed, also their trolls who kill other players for no reason. you better hope the host is a good player as well otherwise they will keep restarting the match every time they die, or leave in the middle of a match if they get to impatient to wait for it to be over. ",0,,,,,,,,,
the humor and visual style are fun ,2,,,,,,,,,
" as does the Quest 2 headset itself, as well as the Quest Link -> PC. Not seeing any performance drops to this degree when playing around with SteamVR by itself, therefore indicating the source of the issue with No Man's Sky itself.",0,,,,,,,,,
Really wish they would improve this because it makes the multiplayer better but at this point I just play on a screen. ,0,,,,,,,,,
 the only real purpose is to learn words and then converse with these aliens where ,1,,,,,,,,,
"the game features a range of fun and challenging objectives, from curing illnesses to managing staff, and gives players the freedom to build their own custom hospitals. ",2,,,,,,,,,
"and so much to explore and interact with,",2,,,,,,,,,
"Now with a multiplayer squad a lot of these are at least manageable, but as a single player experience its more of a mental stability test as any kind of teamwork is completely useless and non existent.",1,,,,,,,,,
 - it is like the game was designed for millennials... you win just by showing up.i guess I can not even get a refund because I bought the key on fanatical.,0,,,,,,,,,
and the trailers give you the impression that this game will be one the biggest challenges you will ever encounter.,0,,,,,,,,,
from real life and from the other games in the series... it just blows my mind.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Time is flying, the earth is rotating, and the no man's sky is still updating.",2,,,,,,,,,
 Staff and patients interact with damn near every object you plop down.,2,,,,,,,,,
Played like 6 hours with 2 friends and saw 100% of what the game has to offer within the first 4 or so.,1,,,,,,,,,
I can only say I've played 99 Hours all of which is single player and I love it still to experience the online side of the game.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Basically, in short, it's a very fun space game with a decent amount of strategy when it comes to resource management early-game, ",2,,,,,,,,,
 but after 6 long years the developers are STILL pushing out amazing updates regularly.,2,,,,,,,,,
had to support the developers and buy the full game,2,,,,,,,,,
The graphics are out of this world (literally),2,,,,,,,,,
this is an awesome remake.,2,,,,,,,,,
"the people who just explode every door that they can see and kill everyone,",1,,,,,,,,,
"takes a while to get used to the controls, but once you have gotten the hang of it, it is easy to work.",2,,,,,,,,,
"If there were 1000 planets, and 1 of them had a lone Giant Squid tucked away in an ocean somewhere, how amazing would it feel to suddenly run into it after 100 hours of gameplay. Or a single planet covered in forest, and suddenly you find a tribe of bigfoot with a fully functioning village tucked away in a valley somewhere? Some things you still would never find. And enough such easter eggs and it could be years before all of them were discovered by the entire player community.",2,,,,,,,,,
 spent almost 2 hours playing ,1,,,,,,,,,
This game was in my Wishlist for a while,1,,,,,,,,,
"The maps and equipment you get are good for a bit, but quickly become boring and repetitive.",0,,,,,,,,,

"The big problem is, that the expedition save game is perma death in combination with time limitation.  and do not have a checkpoint that keeps you falling back to the beginning.",0,,,,,,,,,
 but the game is still receiving regular updates with new content and ,2,,,,,,,,,
"but I’ve pay a complete game, not just 4 maps.",2,,,,,,,,,
On most maps I have to have my resolution and all graphics settings all the way down and the game still stutters and lags.,0,,,,,,,,,
this is worth each and every money I spent.,2,,,,,,,,,
"missing content tbh but that's to be expected now a days, overall that game has a huge potential as long as devs work hard on it and don't bail.",2,,,,,,,,,
absorbed in the vastness of the unknowns in this world.,2,,,,,,,,,
 the wait sure seems to be worth it more and more as I keep returning to the game.,2,,,,,,,,,

Equipment wise the game is really good. You have lots of different weapons and ammunition types to use.,2,,,,,,,,,
"And, if you have a VR headset you can play in VR that is very immersive (and quite motion sickening at times).",2,,,,,,,,,
"great game: cool humor, satisfying gameplay mechanics, reasonable and ""configurable"" pacing - you can move on if you want, you can stay longer to pick up basics and mechanics, so you won not be overwhelmed.",2,,,,,,,,,
Occasional lone wolf that ruins the tactical gameplay and team effort.,0,,,,,,,,,

Only downside is it doesn't save to your account so if you play on a new pc or factory set the one you have you'll have to do it all over again.,0,,,,,,,,,

Gameplay is boring so far but the small chuckles are keeping my curiosity wanting to see more content.,2,,,,,,,,,

I've invested dozens of hours into the game and still have hundreds of hours of gameplay ahead of me. ,2,,,,,,,,,

The Enemies and the civilians can be superposed over each other ,0,,,,,,,,,

Pretty much every option I would desire is in there. You can change difficulty of enemies. You can change damage done to you and your ship. Several other options as well.,2,,,,,,,,,
Either way I died quite a few times just trying to learn the mechanics of the game. This was honestly the most fun I had with the game during my time with it. the sense of discovery and me being an idiot actually made it enjoyable.,2,,,,,,,,,

amazing new vibe love it epic and hard and rewarding,2,,,,,,,,,

Level design could be better.. Maps are too huge and it´s like navigating a maze most of the times. They do not feel logical.,0,,,,,,,,,
"The game is amazing, even with all of the bugs and the I think playing it with other people is great.  ",2,,,,,,,,,
 none of it is extremely difficult but that seems to be the point.,1,,,,,,,,,
 it got teased on YouTube.,1,,,,,,,,,

seems to be a huge success since it will be available even for Nintendo switch soon.,2,,,,,,,,,
"little incentive to upgrade or collect more than one or two ships, even to A+ quality.",0,,,,,,,,,
"My only real complaint at this point is that every system DOES feel very repetitive and gets dull over time, ",0,,,,,,,,,
 I am keen to see how it turns out in a full release.,1,,,,,,,,,
" but the actual game could be described as a bunch of random puzzles, many of which were generic and uninteresting, tied together with a very sparse plot that was ultimately pretty weak.",0,,,,,,,,,
It isn't a competitive shooter and,1,,,,,,,,,
I now have an asus tuf gaming laptop with rtx3050 graphics. ,1,,,,,,,,,

"Somehow, through the absolute toxicity of the terrible launch, we, the community, have successfully filtered out most of the trolls and abusers that used to frequent the forums and subreddits, leaving us with a wholesome, and surprisingly large community of dedicated players from around the world, even bridging game console gaps and encouraging production of the game on as many platforms as possible.",2,,,,,,,,,
"This game is still no optimized for MacOS, I'm set with performance graphic settings and ",0,,,,,,,,,
You can make units (the game's currency) by doing just about anything and gather the necessary resources to move on without spending a single unit.,2,,,,,,,,,

"and most of all, the suppression mechanic simply isn't fun - you can't fire back when you are suppressed.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The community is huge and the most helpful, kind and well behaved... of basically all communities I know so far. Never have I received hate mail, was bullied with in-game mechanics, met a griefer or a cheater etc etc. ",2,,,,,,,,,
"feel very early access and amateurish, compared to modern production, but if you look at it from the nostalgia eye; it feels like a natural evolution of what you see in theme hospital.",1,,,,,,,,,
 a number of other details that will surely improve over the life of this game.,2,,,,,,,,,
even though I am a designer by profession and passion,2,,,,,,,,,
" you could mouse over a patient and the information was minimal but helpful and a click sorted them, this version there is too much information but little is helpful in helping the patient whom just all storm out or die way too frequently where you’re unable to help them to help yourself because they have spent 5 or 6 weeks and even months going to and fro a couple of rooms via a vending machine, nonsense.",0,,,,,,,,,
"if you are for end game content, it would be somehow boring.",0,,,,,,,,,
"overall, the gameplay is solid a few small bugs that make, mechanics are amazing",2,,,,,,,,,
"Trash, after they disabled family sharing, way to kill the fanbase.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The campaigns so far IMO, seem to be a hybrid of a tutorial of new features and rare loot grabs, with twitch drops during the first week of each new campaign.",1,,,,,,,,,
the public lobby servers became harder and harder to find. I'd find myself clicking the find server button every 1-2 minutes because this game lacks a simple server browser.,0,,,,,,,,,
"some might complain about the difficulty being too easy. I might agree to a small degree. but really, this game would get frustrating really quick if you constantly had to fight the systems to stay on top of things. I do agree however that it is really, really difficult to play this game so badly that you would have to start a level over. but then again, I do not really want to.",0,,,,,,,,,
it gets boring real quick it seems like your management decisions in this game have no real consequence ,0,,,,,,,,,
"much like two point hospital,",1,,,,,,,,,
I played it for the grand total of 75 minutes. ,1,,,,,,,,,
"but it again isn't very immersive, usually it only requires you to hold s to auto-target you opponent and hold left mouse, sometimes letting go to cool your gun down so you don't overheat. It's quite simplistic.",2,,,,,,,,,
"But sadly I just felt like refunding it,",0,,,,,,,,,
"It was quite enjoyable at first. however, as you progress, you interaction with the flow of the game diminishes quickly. after a certain point with each hospital, I find myself sitting and staring at the screen for a while as the game plays on its own. sure, I will move my mouse around a bit and get a nice aerial view of it all, but that is about the extent of my involvement.",0,,,,,,,,,
Very realistic and looking forward to future development. ,2,,,,,,,,,
"Professionals will probably debate this fact on the basis of the finer mechanics and the balance, etc, but ",0,,,,,,,,,
 This is still early access you have to remember that which means a lot still has to be made but it got so much potential and its fun.,2,,,,,,,,,
"I have never encountered so many issues with a game before, ",0,,,,,,,,,
I've been playing this game on both PS4 and PC.,1,,,,,,,,,
"overall, a nice game to just do ",2,,,,,,,,,
even in beta stages.,0,,,,,,,,,
Sure right now it’s not completely finished but ,1,,,,,,,,,
"Replayability once you know how to solve the puzzles, there tends to be less replayability, that being said, there are secrets, and depending on how you do things, you may wind up replaying the game until you figure out how to solve these extra puzzles.",0,,,,,,,,,
 anyway it seems a AAA game and not an indie one! ,2,,,,,,,,,
"The diverse and vibrant environments,",2,,,,,,,,,
"One of the best games I've played in a while, ",2,,,,,,,,,
After the first 15 hours ,1,,,,,,,,,
I am curious to see how it survives as a multiplayer game as it clearly is focused on good single player mechanics and gameplay.,1,,,,,,,,,
" on other platforms, and have been a player since 1.0 (Platforms: PS4, PC, Switch).",1,,,,,,,,,
And my friend got motion sickness and I wholeheartedly blame the game for this.,0,,,,,,,,,
" but I've been following RON since I heard of it's release, and I am not disappointed in anyway shape, or form.",2,,,,,,,,,
most hospitals take multiple sessions to beat and some require multiple restarts before you can get going properly.,1,,,,,,,,,
"performance does drop a bit when your campus gets huge, but I suppose that is to be expected.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Multiple times we load in and a enemy spawns directly in front of the fence. Minute we move, one of us is dead right away,",0,,,,,,,,,
"So far, I really like it definitely worth the â‚¬30, - or whatever it's at. ",2,,,,,,,,,
 a modernized version of bullfrog is old classic theme hospital from some of the same developers.,2,,,,,,,,,
"The fact that this game is ""Early Access"" and still feels more complete than ""finished"" AAA titles",2,,,,,,,,,
"My first few hours of the game were spent searching for a sprint button (which is hidden as ""low ready"" in the settings) and being disappointed when my SWAT officer would hobble like a gnome,",0,,,,,,,,,
"I could have a peaceful place to setup shop and explore from. With the last couple of big updates there is now a huge alien tower right next to my base, now there are predators and sentinels everywhere. The updates changed the plants on the planet. Really sucked the peace out of it and made the planet unenjoyable.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Planets feels repetitive, having jumping from two or five for a newcomer feels really great, but when you spend more time and the planets number goes up, its get boring real fast. .I mean, ",0,,,,,,,,,
perfect for theme hospital veterans :-),2,,,,,,,,,
" People will tell you that the game is still broken and still is not good, but of what I have seen, this game has gone from completely useless to a brand new threat to other game making companies.",2,,,,,,,,,
"I paid for a personal computer game, and I expect it to work on a personal computer - and ideally to work like a personal computer game. it is such a shame",0,,,,,,,,,
as the Ready Or Not multiplayer in the alpha didn't really suit the game and didn't compare at all to the amazing coop this game offers now.,0,,,,,,,,,
" the styles and the colors pop with the environment better. every few minutes I am in aww with your animations, music, and objects.",2,,,,,,,,,
all downloadable content is are positive additions that are all well worth it.,2,,,,,,,,,
"I like the game but I cannot play it until they fix the saving issue, some of the levels do not save progression and I cannot do other missions because of it.",0,,,,,,,,,
"The dialogue system is atrocious, It's incredibly slow, ",0,,,,,,,,,
i only play VR mode,1,,,,,,,,,
SO many updates ,2,,,,,,,,,
once you figure out how to reach level goals you can dive in deeper to challenge yourself- I miss the upgrades for all the rooms such as the surgery rooms,2,,,,,,,,,
", but it feels good because its like how dark souls is for me where the difficulty makes it fun",2,,,,,,,,,
"I would prefer to give players the option to skip the hour long waits because some people just want to build their settlements since they completed the game or just not interested in exploring anymore. i'm fine with a 1 to 2 minute wait time but the 2 to 8 hours is just insane, it makes me leave the game cause I lost interest.",0,,,,,,,,,
high learning curve gameplay.,0,,,,,,,,,
all the issues the game had when it first came out,0,,,,,,,,,
then two point hospital is definitely worth checking out.,2,,,,,,,,,
Cross-play for other platforms would be cool too.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Local chat is bad, and it should simply be removed altogether.",0,,,,,,,,,
"Although it has plenty of ironic comments on modern health factories, it feels also impressively correct in its depiction of how these buildings are conceptualized and work in reality. while playing, I heard (in my mind) colleagues saying things this like ""my new office is now in front of a toilet, urgh, and then there is this vending machine where people gather and chat the entire day.",2,,,,,,,,,
and also have other modded players join you.,1,,,,,,,,,
"For me the difficulty slider is a complete swing and miss;  Feels demoralizing to me, and unfortunately makes me want to drop the game entirely.",0,,,,,,,,,
so far I can comfortably say this game is very impressive for an early access game.,2,,,,,,,,,
the fact I could use voice chat was cool.,2,,,,,,,,,
"ever since the update I cannot load into anything, ",0,,,,,,,,,
... Something about exploring new worlds that no one else has seen is just really awesome in my eyes and ,2,,,,,,,,,
"As for the ""profanity"" filter you cannot even say Got, Gotten or Closer, as well as many other non-swear words...",0,,,,,,,,,
"Yes you can be a space pirate and pvp or pve with friends, however that is a very narrow aspect of the game, ",2,,,,,,,,,
" ""If this game had SC's flight simulation characteristics IT would be the best damn space sim ever!"" Alas while both of these game scratch the itch of Galactic exploration, survival and progression the flight characteristics of NMS are like Pong (for those old enough to know what I'm talking about) compared to SC being a detailed X-Plane commercial airline flight simulation run. However, that doesn't detract from the enjoyment of NMS space battles ",1,,,,,,,,,
" there being a large number of patients sitting at my gps offices, while the gps take their grand old time seeing to them.",0,,,,,,,,,
on this management cake.,2,,,,,,,,,
"at first I was not going to buy the game, but I watched some of the videos on YouTube and I thought I might give it a go.",2,,,,,,,,,
If you have any doubts just watch recent coop gameplay streams on YouTube or Twitch.,1,,,,,,,,,
great game the game is really entertaining and retains the essence of hospital theme.,2,,,,,,,,,
"Thank you Hello Games Supporting this game that’s been lost to the bigger publishers, and I’m so glad that this still happens here.",2,,,,,,,,,
it worth buying now more than ever.,2,,,,,,,,,
Overall this game has been a very enjoyable experience this was the first game I had to download.,2,,,,,,,,,
"or you're looking for a game to fight space pirates, alien drones, tame animals, build incredible bases or just take some beautiful screenshots, I would recommend you try this game - ",2,,,,,,,,,
"this is a good game with fun content. however, it is far too expensive. the regional pricing that exists on this game is utterly discriminatory. when the game can be had for a 1/6th of the price if you live somewhere else, it is patently unfair. ",0,,,,,,,,,
" would make a few small changes, maybe add a leveling system or even a shop so that you have something to work towards.",0,,,,,,,,,
Even learning new skills by just playing,2,,,,,,,,,
"the ""tutorial/familiarization level is pretty bad... and stuff that should be possible, like placing 2 benches in a corner with a plant in between them is not…",0,,,,,,,,,
" the game is quite easy but hard to master because if you're not aware most of the time, you'll get killed easily so pay attention!",2,,,,,,,,,
I don't know if I’m the only one who has this but  (And yes I have tried full screen and all that jazz) so if I’m not the only one who is getting this please fix it and if I am please to me how to fix it tks also this is a great game,0,,,,,,,,,
game hay Hope to have Vietnamese language support soon,1,,,,,,,,,
I already reviewed this game but it recently got it's biggest update so I'll update as well ,0,,,,,,,,,
adding new and varied hyper-micromanagement challenges that keep me engaged.,2,,,,,,,,,
"No server browser, and (even when steam charts says 4000 players online) no matches found (east coast USA).",0,,,,,,,,,
"a game with better music-better controls (very subjective, I just really liked the controls of hospital and im not used to campus.",2,,,,,,,,,
 then you can eliminate 50% of the frustration caused by the broken team AI.,0,,,,,,,,,
"No Mans Sky gives you the freedom to do whatever you want, while also guiding you along a path that shows you all the game can offer, which is quite a lot.",2,,,,,,,,,

" The tension is palpable as I try to avoid being found and eliminated, and ",2,,,,,,,,,
"No Man's Sky (NMS) tries to make everything as easy as possible, and finds ways to make the game steadily easier if you want it.",2,,,,,,,,,
Crashed all the time on my Lenovo 330S and was mostly unplayable ,0,,,,,,,,,
the guilt for not having pvp ,0,,,,,,,,,
"the developers put a lot of details in that game, from the entertaining radio moderator up to the many different people in your hospital which I also sometimes just like to watch and see what they do.",2,,,,,,,,,

"""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. "" The 3-rd law by Arthur C. Clarke. I started a review with Clarke's quotation, because the world of ""No Man's Sky"" is really magical despite its obvious sci-fi basis. ",2,,,,,,,,,
Not worth 40 dollars in its current state. ,0,,,,,,,,,
and good for screenshot lol,2,,,,,,,,,
I really wish to see this game blossom into a true nightmarish realistic tactical shooter. ,1,,,,,,,,,
"With live players this is slightly more complicated. Maybe issue is that everyone wanting ""trigger time"" rush in to ""get that kill"" and wiping the group instead.",0,,,,,,,,,
 This game will not hold your hand and walk you through,1,,,,,,,,,
"When you want to pick up a certain amount of resources, you have to use certain keys to reduce or increase the amount of resources, instead of being able to enter the exact number somewhere in a text box and  instead of using a scroll bar. And every menu uses a different combination of keys to control it. In some menus, you can scroll up and down with the mouse wheel, in some you have to use the keyboard. This also adds to the feeling that different teams are working on this game quite independently.",0,,,,,,,,,
really fun especially when you communicate with teammates. ,2,,,,,,,,,
"when you start each hospital, it is fun for about 20 minutes but then the game goes from intermediate to very very hard very quickly as you become overloaded with incurable dying patients, debt that never seems to go away, and everyone wanting to get promoted at the same time",0,,,,,,,,,
but I think the devs could learn a bit from Escape From Tarkov,2,,,,,,,,,
"If you like progression, you may be in luck, as the game offers many ways to upgrade your ship, suit, and multitool so you can do nothing faster.",2,,,,,,,,,
I guess sales will rocket when PvP mode is added.,2,,,,,,,,,
"While Ready or Not and SWAT 4 occupy different spaces for me, those spaces are closely bound, and ",2,,,,,,,,,

"fresh and good idea.it is similar to 2ph, but I find that they made good use of the engine and mechanics to make a more or less realistic and funny simulation of a campus.",2,,,,,,,,,
"discovering new diseases and treatment rooms,",1,,,,,,,,,
"Recently, they added options to alter the game difficulty enabling all to switch off and on different aspects of the game, you can now alter how strong enemies are or disable them, environmental hazards or death penalties also.",1,,,,,,,,,
"Now I don't feel like I'm wondering only to find what's at the center the galaxy. I can find planets that I adore, build a base with a portal, and always return to it and see what nice shots I can take with photo mode.

I dislike how when I click find session to play with strangers it kicks me back to main menu and tells me I lost connection to the server host.,0,,,,,,,,,
"the species unique, the ships totally varied, and no matter what, you can and will always have a different story in the game than anyone else.",2,,,,,,,,,

 as well as different difficulty levels to cater to different playstyles.,1,,,,,,,,,

"you only get like a couple of guns that other players cannot use,",0,,,,,,,,,
I expected this to be a one hell of a grind fest but with custom settings you can play it with your own terms which is perfect. This alone made me digging in and I love it.,2,,,,,,,,,
"I understand this is hard a game but once you die you won’t get chance to continue its kind of frustrating, if they decide to have revival you could instead get a low rank but still continue the game not just watching people (friends playing)",0,,,,,,,,,
" it is ... a more scaled-back, mindless experience,",2,,,,,,,,,
 you will never find yourself lacking incentive to continue exploring.,2,,,,,,,,,
"This game's story is gripping, fast-paced, action-packed and deep. ",2,,,,,,,,,
"I know that this is a game focused on procedurally generated worlds, and I expected exactly that, and I got exactly what I expected.",2,,,,,,,,,
 it will run from buttery smooth to hard freezing and stuttering and always in the worst moments.,0,,,,,,,,,
but when I started to play my anxiety curiosity increased rapidly. ,2,,,,,,,,,
and the social aspect of the game is almost non-existent.,0,,,,,,,,,
STEAMDECK - runs WAYY better and stable on my deck in all modes vs. 2022 gen gaming PC where I get a fair amount of random crashes.,2,,,,,,,,,
"The game is significantly incomplete and will never truly be a tactical shooter until the protective gear the player gives themselves and their team will actually protect them from the threats they face, the player is given ample opportunity and resource to analyze the location, plan and memorize their movements and strategies, and effectively execute said movements and strategies.",0,,,,,,,,,

"Gunplay is wonderful and realistic but has its flaws, ",2,,,,,,,,,
" either by exploring different planets to get more loot (to satisfy the little capitalist in me), ",2,,,,,,,,,
game is on par with games such as escape from Tarkov and Insurgency sandstorm,2,,,,,,,,,
" Of course, it is a remake of an old classic, but it has upgrades, new additions and a fun narrative that makes it feel very much like it is own game.",2,,,,,,,,,
"You get an interceptor on you and there is no escape. You can run and go into hyperdrive, destroy all their ships, hide out. If there is no way to defeat the enemy, what’s the point?",0,,,,,,,,,
I would definitely recommend everyone to at least try this game out,2,,,,,,,,,
This game is a great tactical shooter. ,2,,,,,,,,,
"I always liked tycoon games, and this is one of the best I have played lately.",2,,,,,,,,,
I enjoy exploration type games that involve vehicles as they really open up the speed you can explore at. The Roamer being my first vehicle that I upgraded fully is the one I have the most experience with. It was interestingly powerful in some cases; wielding a super powerful mining laser that worked quickly and a power scanning system that made tracking specific structures possible.,2,,,,,,,,,
"In fact, a ""difficulty settings"" option would have been nice at all. ",0,,,,,,,,,

"meaning when you start more advanced hospitals, you will get constantly messages to validate manually to decide between keeping a patient in the hospital (and probably having him die here with no treatment) or send him home.",0,,,,,,,,,

"I used to keep a notepad on my phone that I updated before sleep to what I must do because it felt so satisfying to play that game, I didn't want to lose the momentum.",2,,,,,,,,,
I LOVE this game. It demonstrates the difficulty of what it's like to be a police officer and enforces quick thinking along with situational awareness.,2,,,,,,,,,
"there are not a bunch of decisions you have to make or details you need to keep track of compared to some other sims, but you still get the feeling you are in control of the gameplay.",2,,,,,,,,,
My only real complaint about the game is that the interface system is a little odd as you have to press and hold keys to do most actions instead of just clicking quickly.,0,,,,,,,,,
which is mainly what I've done. The actual friendly AI is pretty decent - been some minor bugs with their pathing but 90% of the time they have behaved as expected and carried out orders properly.,2,,,,,,,,,
I have had to occasionally fire a doctor or nurse who is not worth the raise they want and sometimes physically move to them to where they should be rather than hanging out in a lounge.,0,,,,,,,,,

overall great game.  had some good times playing it though. grade A,2,,,,,,,,,
I like the game and I like two point hospital as well but I had hoped the items had been updated more. ,2,,,,,,,,,
"This game sucks, way too SLOW for combat, ",0,,,,,,,,,
Slowly and methodically infiltrate a highly detailed environment that silently reveals a dark story as you attempt to rescue civilians and bring suspects to justice.,2,,,,,,,,,
The only annoying part is that u sometimes need to search the whole building for 1 knife or a weapon that u didn’t report and cannot finish the mission because of that.,0,,,,,,,,,

sandbox mode gives you different difficulty levels to start. ,2,,,,,,,,,

"The Atlas is a mystery. I have barely deciphered the first alien race is language I have encountered, but slowly learning to communicate. I am really curious about these infected stations I keep encountering...There is some kind of backstory to the sentinels being some kind of self-replicating machines that took over the universe, and I am excited to find out more about it.",2,,,,,,,,,
the community work is so appreciated as well,2,,,,,,,,,
This also adds to the feeling that different teams are working on this game quite independently.,0,,,,,,,,,
" it was a flourishing/paradise planet with ancient remains/natural burial sites, and I had the sense of the community kind of ""settling"" the planet themselves to make profit from the resources, just a really nice feeling compared to Version 1.",2,,,,,,,,,

"maybe I am missing a key trick but I have tried to build some really well designed hospitals with every trackable component of success considered, but it always ends the same, with way too many patients and just not enough space for them all, then bankruptcy.",0,,,,,,,,,
the options to play online challenges with friends who also have the game is fun for those who need some more social interaction in the game.,2,,,,,,,,,
"steam has become mired beneath  that ""thumbs down"" any game that a) is not free, b) is not perfect (even if early access), and/or c) is not the game they ~mistakenly~ thought it would be.",0,,,,,,,,,
you don't get rewarded for killing other players and the mechanics are currently not made for pvp obviously.,0,,,,,,,,,
" gunplay is on the level of say tarkov, ",2,,,,,,,,,
but I am not sure if I will ever buy the game.,0,,,,,,,,,
I'm partial to things such asthis game delivers all that pretty darn well.,2,,,,,,,,,
if you do not already know it is a hospital simulation game. it is emphasis is more on its humorous aesthetics the strong gameplay mechanics.,2,,,,,,,,,
cause it is just that good,2,,,,,,,,,
I preordered this game because I was so excited for it after playing two point hospital.,2,,,,,,,,,

"When a player settles down on a planet and makes a base, and the things they find there can become interesting just because of the connection to that procedural content.",2,,,,,,,,,
map crafting and menus in general are horrible to navigate and use especially crafting when I want to build X but it doesn’t tell me what I need to build it ,0,,,,,,,,,

"and definitely a game you should either have in your library, or your Wishlist.",2,,,,,,,,,
"even on the lower settings, the physics are good (if a bit funny when they bug out),",2,,,,,,,,,
"The game's environments are highly detailed and realistic, with a wide variety of textures and lighting effects that really bring the world to life.",2,,,,,,,,,
"Fantastic to play with friends, alone or even with others.",2,,,,,,,,,
On the technical side I have not encountered any issues even with a pretty big level 18 hospital ,2,,,,,,,,,
despite the fact that I usually don't enjoy the survival/crafting genre.,0,,,,,,,,,
This game is awesome! ,2,,,,,,,,,
"But I always loved theme hospital, and have not played it in a very, very long time.",2,,,,,,,,,

"I've never reviewed a game,",1,,,,,,,,,
"Staff being reduced from 4 types to 3 feels like a real step back, and means teachers feel very easy to manage while assistants and janitors need tougher decisions for how you want to use them. it also seems that staff need to have jobs assigned one by one while in hospital you could easily manage everyone is jobs on the same screen.

 A graphic level without being a great game has adapted very well to the new times a level of gameplay is accessible to all types of players.,2,,,,,,,,,
i think sandbox mode would be great for this game but they do not know it. adding all the features to sandbox mode is possible they just have to use their heads on how to add it.,0,,,,,,,,,

There are some good things about this game which you can read about online,2,,,,,,,,,
Hands down the game is really really good although I would really love to see more choices/options for customization to weapons and outfits (things to make your operator stand out) ,0,,,,,,,,,
the ability to play online with people and still be able to communicate is a huge upside in my opinion.,2,,,,,,,,,

"I hope the devs look at making an attack and defend type game mode comparable to Rainbow Six Siege, ",2,,,,,,,,,
" love space trading,",2,,,,,,,,,
"Some scenarios would I would recommend slow and methodical (using silencers, mirror wands, lock picks), whereas, others I recommend loud and proud (battering rams, stinger/flash grenades, C2). The choice is up to the player how they want to approach each situation.",2,,,,,,,,,
This cartoonish medical management sim is hilarious and extremely addictive! ,2,,,,,,,,,
This is the most underrated title out there imo.,2,,,,,,,,,
"But I can't play it anymore: the full-screen white flashes during transitory actions (engaging/disengaging pulse engine, finish loading the game, etc. ) turn my eyes into soup and give me migraines within 40 minutes. ",0,,,,,,,,,

Once you setup a farm you can get pretty much infinite money (units) and you can convert units into nanites by buying spaceships at space stations and trashing them. ,1,,,,,,,,,

"And when something is being built in the settlement, I have to provide resources, so I have to go here and there and collect the resources, so that one hour later I can do the same thing and one hour later I can do the same thing, and so on. ",0,,,,,,,,,
" I can safely say that the game has fulfilled my expectations to what it has to offer this early on, which is a Co-Operative Tactical SWAT game with multiple methods of completing the tasks given, however has very little to offer",1,,,,,,,,,
There is a steep learning curve to become familiar with the games technology but that is part of the fun.,2,,,,,,,,,
It would benefit greatly from steam workshop compatibility for some variety with regards to wall art and rugs.,2,,,,,,,,,
The only thing I wish this had was a way to stay within a dialogue menu when interacting with the aliens as you can only do one thing and then have to re-initiate the dialogue to do more.,0,,,,,,,,,

 currently the game got max 5 hours of content and that's stretching it.,0,,,,,,,,,
This is probably the best exploration slash survival game out their in general and almost certainly bar none in the sci-fi genre.,2,,,,,,,,,
"in my opinion I think it's good to have a lot of topics like “Planes"" that are randomly spawned, with each star having a different climate, such as being very hot from the volcanic star's surface, cold to ice. and almost no living things Or even stars with radiation that will cause our blood to decrease all the time.

Although this doesn’t solve the problem for people trying to play in third-person view, if you are like me and absolutely despise the camera being moved around without you making it move, this is a way to fix it (Assuming you enjoy first person)Sadly first person has its own set of issues like extremely low FOV that doesn’t seem to be able to be changed (Even by the FOV slider which may in fact be a bug)",0,,,,,,,,,
