Camera controls are very well controlling.,1,1,6
"The game's universe is an expanse so vast and boundless that it seems to stretch into infinity and beyond. Here, you have the freedom to wander aimlessly through an ever-expanding cosmos, armed with nothing but your relentless curiosity and a sense of bewilderment. ",1,0,43
It's a fantastic game and I would recommend to all.,1,1,10
Everything is autopiloted- Feels more casual than candy crush ,1,0,9
"On planet nothing really ""challenges"" you, you feel no danger, as even the most menacing creatures perish in just      seconds, to your puny mining laser",1,0,25
Be patient and follow the storyline as,1,1,7
"it is funny, it is weird illnesses and has so much life, yes it has it is flaws am sure, I am not so easily displeased though, it is addictive, ",1,1,30
" I have not got into the downloadable content yet,  it is fun and it has had a lot of big improvements to it since release,",1,1,25
some customization of the outfits for your staff and I believe more is coming,1,1,14
"in my opinion, the team really ironed out some of the less satisfying elements of two point hospital and gave us a highly polished, fun, and zany treat in tpc. it is not completely perfect; I wish my students were a little more efficient at managing their needs (eg being very unhappy due to boredom but ignoring the entertainment around them to get a drink and then idle on a table), and I would like to micro-manage my staff a tiny bit more (eg assistants with the highest medical training should always go to work in the medical office), but there is nothing that is more than a very minor annoyance.",1,1,111
 but not as crazy as it seems on the trailers.,1,0,10
"it is fun,",1,0,3
"It now feels as though you're travelling in a universe that's stuffed full of possibilities with regards to what you'll confront when you set your ship down on a planet. From weather, atmospheric hazards, and volatile plant/animal life, to jaw-dropping vistas and twisted alien environments, you just never know what you're in for when you open your ship's cockpit, and planets are now laden with gear and long-lost artefacts to discover and sell as you work to upgrade and improve every aspect of yourself and your trusty spaceship.",1,1,88
" updated visuals and graphics, lots of animations for variety while managing the hospital itself, things generally do not get boring.",1,1,20
"love the game, an amazing combination between nostalgia and up-to-date mechanics.a joy for players who used to enjoy theme hospital or rollercoaster tycoon style games,",1,1,25
Was that a future Two Point Zoo Easter Egg on the radio? Because if so... just take my money now...,1,1,20
On MB Pro M2 it runs satisfying good on 4k.,1,1,10
"overall, the game is not difficult, but I honestly find it reasonably challenging.",1,1,13
" in the 2nd stage, I am constantly having to juggle loans in order to meet the requirements of my upgraded courses: build this, build that, hire this -- that is $120k total and I do not have that on hand, so I need a loan. loans have interest and instalment payments that drag down profits. I am still profitable many months, but not by much. I could probably have just skated by on the status quo for another school year to grind cash, but the game allows me to keep pushing if I want to. Anyway, a lot of love obviously went into this game.",1,1,105
"Overall, this game is very polished and feels mostly complete.",1,1,10
" But now, after 17 free expansions, the game is freaking good and definitively worth to check out",1,1,17
" there is lots of stuff to do: Base building, Galaxy exploration, Planetary Exploration, Underwater exploration, Underground exploration, amazing graphics, many different vehicles, pets, trading, managing fleets and lots more, as of now you can even curate your own small town.",1,1,40
"Space exploration in the game is also fun, hunting down blueprints,",1,1,11
"it makes it so you can do whatever you want to without feeling pressured into something specific, but it can also make it feel like there's nothing to do.",1,1,29
" do various quests, follow the 2 main storyline plots and explore the lore of the vast space of No Man's Sky. This game while in my opinion has no ""developer-made"" endgame has an endgame in which it's the player that decides what they want to call endgame, and I love that, ",1,1,51
 Not only in terms of visual design but atmosphere on most levels can feel different. At the gas station robbery gone wrong you (the SWAT boys) feel in control and the layout tends to give you that feeling but other levels like the birthday party or night club make you feel very on edge.,1,1,54
"The different levels not only all have a entirely different vibe to each other but also can host numerous game modes from simple ""barricaded suspects"" where you have to ferret out the baddies while securing hostages to ""Active Shooter"" where some nutcase(s) are going around the level sharing their vast lead fortune with lucky civilians to bomb defusal which is pretty self-descriptive.",1,1,62
The servers are ok and I can join my friends almost instantly.,1,1,12
this game is really good if you like,1,1,8
 sandbox-style sims games.,1,1,3
what a great game with interesting levels to explore.,1,1,9
"you can hop over to the forums and see stickies with all the progress being made, and developers will read your feedback and sometimes even reply to confirm if they are working on your issue or offer some kind of workaround.",1,1,41
" When these issues are fixed I will be happy to come back to this review and update it with a glowing, no strings attached recommendation, until then…",1,1,27
funny than expected. ,1,1,3
"Graphics are good, some screen tearing, but that seemed to solve itself out.",1,1,13
but honestly find the ones with the challenges way more fun.,1,1,11
"if you like sim games with great not-so-dark humour, when you take a break from your horror games, then this may be for you.",1,1,24
"thanks to the broad-spectrum of opportunities of executing a mission, creating an SOP, carrying out the SOP, utilizing every equipment differently, trusting your squamates. ",1,1,24
"The anxiety and adrenaline rush you feel every minute as you move on from door to door, not knowing when the enemy will rush up on you, the constant requirement of focusing, and being there mentally 100% is something you don't feel in every game.",1,1,45
"The game is highly replayable, ",1,1,5
"The way customizetion for freighters/ships works is that for the looks u just have to find what you want,(there’s also a site where you can filter all the spaceship wings, tails, shapes, looks and see if your dream ship available for you to pick up with exact coordinates to find it).",1,1,51
" if you are into this then hop on the nms reddit/coordinates exchange where I can guarantee you, you WILL find what your looking for although it may be a long journey to find it ",1,1,34
This is what Rainbow 6 should have been,1,1,8
"Achievements aren't that hard, you can enjoy the game without worrying about missing some of them.",1,1,16
" they combined the regular inventory & cargo slots into one list, and you can now only equip tech upgrades in Technology slots, meaning that any upgrades equipped to a normal inventory slot became unequipped, but was left in your inventory as a regular item that you can just re-equip at any time as long as you have an available tech slot for it. ",1,1,63
"Don't get me wrong, there are pretty views that are well worth it, ",1,0,13
"However, there is just more to it now than there was at launch. From quests to NPCs, there is simply more content to experience now than there was originally. And they managed to keep all of the positive aspects of the game (random and procedurally generated locations/plants/animals, space exploration and flying your starship) and add to it without harming the core that was there.",1,1,64
i like that you can encourage certain skills based on your play style and student needs.,1,1,16
I went in expecting theme hospital styled game but with a college campus setting and got it.,1,1,17
"I'm sure it will be better after some time in development, but",1,0,12
"It is an extremely challenging SWAT simulator that This balance of realism makes it firmly a kill or be killed situation where you must carefully execute door breaches, tactical manoeuvres and room clears in order to keep you or your team and the civilians you serve to protect, safe.",1,1,49
"boasts an array of realistic tactics, equipment, physics, environments, and firearm mechanics. ",1,1,12
it is refreshing change from the early access misery that most games seem to be these days.,1,1,17
"I've only scratched the surface, but I had the most jaw-dropping fun when I hopped in my repaired spacecraft on the planet and seamlessly went into space, docked into an orbiting space station, talked to aliens but didn't know their language (yet), went back to my ship, went to another planet and made a server first discovery, and proceeded to spend hours exploring.",1,1,63
path finding looks more flexible in narrow areas as well ().  one issue with the new formula is that I find myself running the game on the fastest speed most of the time.,1,1,33
Ready or Not is truly a very immersive game coming as it goes into much deeper detail on what our brave police officers have to go through.,1,1,27
but this game stands out very differently from something compared to Rainbow 6 ,1,1,13
 over 60 hours in so far and still having a blast.,1,1,11
"runs like a dream on my modest gaming laptop,",1,1,9
"the games always full of fresh figures and keeps the experience fresh and new since everyone’s different playstyles are gonna clash, ",1,1,21
"but ONE TIP, never rush unless your breach and clearing a room or floor with your squad, rushing is the quickest way to end up another statistic in the mission,",1,1,30
"the tutorial part is pretty smooth and explain the basics for the non-familiar players, so have no fear to try it out if you have never played two point hospital before !",1,1,32
"for the people who have played th and are looking for some challenge, I have myself finished two point hospital probably 5 times already in max difficulty, and I have found this game enough challenging, so do not worry !",1,1,40
this game has been on my Wishlist since the pre orders came in I’ve finally gone and bought it I have to say I am very glad ,1,1,27
 highly recommend this game to any space lovers,1,1,8
that you can still explore which is cool.,1,1,8
after a lengthy time of playing the game I must say it is awesome ,1,1,14
As much as I’ve replayed the maps so it doesn't get very repetitive.,1,1,13
the ai seems to be in different spots ,1,1,8
"i am big on puzzles, and this game definitely fits those categories.",1,1,12
"i am big on weird mind-bending stories, and this game definitely fits those categories.",1,1,14
I have 30 hours and I still haven't even touched half the content ,1,1,13
I just love the gameplay loop so much .,1,1,9
I love love love the game due to being an old hospital tycoon player back in the day,1,1,18
"In any case, I highly recommend this game to anyone who even remotely likes the sandbox / survival genre.",1,1,19
 largely due to the lack of difficulty and compelling achievements.,1,1,10
"incredibly addictive game-play,",1,1,3
but updated for modern 3d graphics.,1,1,6
"it is like theme hospital, clearly in art style and comedy style. ",1,1,12
"For now, it’s better to have friends to play with already, as you can look for servers.",1,1,17
"Made to work as a team, Coop.  You can just choose coop and it takes you to a random server. Game can be played solo, with 3 AI teammates. They kinda get in the way and if you die then the whole mission is over, you can t take over with an AI teammate.",1,1,54
"make sure cleanliness, happiness and boredom are controlled. - recruit and train your employees to perform the tasks you have assigned to them.- accept challenges or patients from other hospitals.-  ",1,1,30
very simple and short story but the gameplay covers it extensively.,1,1,11
I am having so much fun on it... so much so that I had to take all 3 dlcs in one go.,1,1,22
" this is certainly a game that creates a very immersive experience for those who are looking for a realistic police tactical team simulation that utilizes similar tactics, weaponry, equipment, and devices to real tactical teams.",1,1,35
"The game is amazing, so far. ",1,0,6
What's better is it isn’t your typical shoot everything that moves game. ,1,1,12
A game that sucks you out of your room and immerses you in the environment ,1,1,15
After 538 hours ,1,1,3
" meeting a new set of friends on the game,",1,1,9
 I would say it’s worth playing.,1,1,6
"Extremely fun, especially with exploits which make the game bearable ",1,1,10
"I have spent far too much time naming systems, planets, and creatures knowing full well that the chances of another living human finding them are next to zero. It seems pointless, yet I am fascinated with it. Putting silly names in the hopes that one day some random person will find these easter eggs.",1,1,54
I love the graphic design as it reminds me of theme hospital but ,1,1,13
"I love the graphic design, has reasonable quality and is totally cute.",1,1,12
"I would LOVE to see more aesthetic customizations for your ship, I lucked out and got a pretty cool X-Wing sequel fighter, but I'm still gonna need to upgrade at some point and I want to make ships look COOL,",1,1,40
 and maybe spend some resources and earn a little credit from fixing up ships like a mechanic.,1,1,17
I’m addicted it’s so good the kind of game that helps me wind down while giving me a challenge ,1,1,19
thank you saga/ two point for making and distributing this game!,1,1,11
it dose lack a little with content and a few bugs but I do think it will get better with some updated versions a content update and/or a dlc ,1,1,29
"If you love tactical shooters, anything that involves SWAT, FBI etc you wont find a game better than this.",1,1,19
"I've enjoyed this game on XBOX as well as here on Steam, so my hours are slightly deflated in total.",1,1,20
we have worked so hard to get a s grade on missions. You do not understand how hard and great feeling it is when you finally get one after 50 attempts. ,1,0,31
me and a buddy have been playing for months now. ,1,0,10
"no learning curve, just relaxing and fun. ",1,1,7
"watching the medical devices ""cure"" patients is funny and interesting.",1,1,10
So if you watched any of the trailers you would already know that this game offers a near infinite universe.,1,1,20
"That said, I've enjoyed playing in single player mode and have accumulated ",1,1,12
almost 3000h since it came out.,1,1,6
The overhype of No Man's Sky is particularly hard to dissect even now due to how many different pieces of it there were.,1,1,23
"the room template system, quality tooltips, and excellent iconography make it very easy to navigate and manage.",1,1,17
like in Escape from Tarkov ,1,1,5
"Vast galaxies end epic universes to explore,",1,1,7
 and the regular updates make the game worthwhile to keep playing.,1,1,11
"absolutely loving it, the steam version definitely has the edge over the console versions (switch, xbox one, etc.)",1,1,18
"that is mainly to support the game in its development when the game is worked on by an indie team. Best of all, they don't try to sell you dumb skins/NFTs for the game, or any Pay 2 Win things like other multibillion companies do.",1,1,45
" The gravity storm feature, affecting both your jump height and visual experience, is particularly noteworthy. However,  the drive to explore random planets dwindles. ",1,1,23
"for you competitive folks, two point hospital offers competitive online play with your friends. various in-game challenges pit you against your friends to be the best at an aspect of hospital management, and the leaderboards allow you to compare your standing with your steam friends.",1,1,45
"but I just cannot stand collect and craft genres. There are now custom modes though and you can setup your ""universe"" with rules similar to Minecraft Servers, offering a much broader scope of gameplay, and I feel I have a place here now.",1,1,43
great user interface improvements.,1,1,4
"some developers know how to manage their communities, but two point studios' approach to community interaction is far above par -- they listen to the community, and have crafted a game that scrubs can honestly say have contributed to with their support and feedback.",1,1,44
"Some of the text in this game is pretty great, ",1,1,10
"some of it is a little creepy even, if you get the spooks when exploring hidden abandoned sunken underwater ruins or crash sights, this might be too spooks for you, if your claustrophobic it could also make you a little uneasy.",1,1,41
The game is great! It highlights a lot of the difficulties that law enforcement faces when having to make split decisions. ,1,1,21
"The last aspect is the most important in this type of game, I’m really serious, it feels like being inside the action in every moment of the game, you'll experience fear, anger, concussions",1,1,33
also thanks to the incredible quality of audio experience.  (if you have the right headset ahah) ,1,1,16
the added further replay ability in floors ,1,1,7
the most recent update added further ability in floors ,1,1,9
with modifiers and recent balance changes have made the game more diverse and while still little easy much more agency is allotted to the player to improve reliability while also still being relatively unpredictable,1,1,34
they tell the story of what unfolded without the need of exhibition.,1,1,12
The world and maps are so full of detail that ,1,1,10
this gives you flexibility and you can learn the best setups without being punished for trying what you think is better.,1,1,21
when the day comes that I do get bored of it I can see this game being fun to hop on while I watch some twitch or a movie.,1,1,29
worth a listen even if you don’t buy the game.,1,1,10
 album works but mixes from in-game on YouTube best capture the feeling.,1,1,12
you are presented with enough monthly and quarterly data that ,1,1,10
you actually feel like you are running a real hospital.,1,1,10
"Being well into the game but not at the end yet, I still have a lot of discoveries to make.",1,1,20
" The lore is given to you bit by bit, slowly contributing to the sense of being estranged in an alien galaxy with no memory whatsoever of what had happened before.",1,1,30
i love being able to see the stats of my steam friends hospitals and being able to have some healthy competition with them.,1,1,23
and a little patience I enjoy learning and exploring. The key is to learn the basics and go from there.,1,1,20
"I play in VR, and with time,  Luckily, the uncomfortableness of the glasses makes it easier to disconnect, take a breather, and then enjoy again another day.",1,1,27
"i play on xbox and really wanted to play this game, ",1,1,11
"so I hopped on my pc and bought it, and im not good since i'v never really used keyboard before",1,1,20
" but the physics, guns, enemies, equipment, movement, etc make it unique and just fun in general.",1,1,16
"If SWAT and Old Tom Clancy, had a kid said it to the filter and slapped in cut throat jump scares then this is a game for you.",1,1,28
if you're open to a thinking man's casual-friendly space adventure game with a welcoming online community...  ,1,1,16
No Man's Sky is an experience that truly shines once you can finally see the light beyond the proverbial hill (the initial tutorial/learning curve).,1,1,24
it is an easy to learn but difficult to master gameplay loop that has a nice level of complexity while still remaining accessible.,1,1,23
"It is fun to play even in public matches, ",1,1,9
"It's given me maybe 8 hours of fun,  It's an entertaining game.",1,0,12
Kudos to the developers still putting in work onto a game that,1,1,12
"That being said, the level design itself is top notch with a superb level of environmental storytelling. ",1,1,17
"if you are sensitive to disturbing imagery, this game may not be for you.",1,1,14
the developer team are actively in communication with the players and ,1,1,11
seem to be regularly working on new updates and features.,1,1,10
"the fact there does not seem to have a fail state could turn off the more hardcore while the frequent challenges might turn off casual gamers. that said, it is easy to turn off your brain and just enjoy the controlled chaos of this games environment.",1,1,46
"The vr mode is insanely immersive especially when you take off in your spaceship, fly out of the atmosphere and to another planet.",1,1,23
This game is early access ,1,1,5
so obviously it will change and grow but the core gameplay is incredibly fun and ,1,1,15
the devs actually care.,1,1,4
two point hospital is a fun simulator and ,1,1,8
very easy to get the hang of even if you have not played theme hospital before.,1,1,16
"Watched Twitch streams for a whole week to get a feel for the game, and a weeks’ worth of free drops, including 3 A class hauler ships, 2 A class fighter ships, and 3 A class multitools, plus some neat cosmetics. Then I started playing. And I was hooked.",1,1,49
"And when I play with my friends I love the online play function, it IS GREAT, but, then I want to solo play ",1,0,23
 the huge champion pool means that every game will be different. ,1,1,11
"Dota is a time-honoured esports game, has some esoteric mechanics",1,1,10
Everyone loves a good comeback. I bought this way back when it first came out and I was one of those people who played over 2 hours and couldn't request a refund.,1,1,32
 I am flat out amazed at how much content there is in this game as of May 2022!,1,1,18
"I enjoy going with a full team being commander for the first mission, then running it solo until I move on to the next map or mission type.",1,1,28
I enjoy this game a lot and it is great to play while listening to podcasts.,1,1,16
realistic-feeling space flight/travel,1,1,3
"it is for all ages and even with its tongue in cheek humour, it has enough complexities to appeal to those looking to master the mechanics.",1,1,26
really hits the right spot in the sim and management game genre about a hospital,1,1,15
 by cartoony enough that its very un-intimidating and fun!,1,1,9
"The ""seasons"" events are a great way to breathe new life into this game and I have done two of them so far. everyone starting on the same world with random equipment and a random ship is awesome, as is everyone having the same planet as a goal.",1,1,48
"The game stuck to its core and never tried to go down the route of censoring the gameplay for the sake of ""political correctness"".",1,1,24
 but there is still nothing else out there which so effectively touches on the same lonely/desolate/hopeful sci-fi vibe.,1,1,18
and offers replay value to get a better score,1,1,9
The ranking system keeps you entertained by approaching a mission a better or different way.,1,1,15
this game is insane the fact that nobody will ever be able to explore the entire map proves how insane it is. its endless!!,1,1,24
"Together with world-building that's done with environmental storytelling and enemy design of the levels, the context of these situations shows clear depth within its smaller details that make it stand out.",1,1,31
 along with subtle details in audio,1,1,6
"ugh, it is such a good game and it is so difficult to turn off, and that is a bit of a bad thing, because I have got a few exams very soon.",1,1,33
Very fun with friends. We spent like half an hour messing around with the different weapons in the lobby and the mechanics are awesome.,1,1,24
"With that being said, I think this game has HUGE potential and if the developers looked at the high-ranking mods that are out for this game and make it part of the game as standard, then it would GREATLY improve the game and its marketing.",1,1,45
 I cannot wait to see what comes next!,1,1,8
"The game always had its hidden moments, unknowns and, Easter eggs but now it has true opportunities for the kind of specialization SM talked about in his pre-launch interviews.",1,1,29
". . long story short, there are now two 100+ hour saves on my PS4. Nonetheless, I was onboard for 4k/60FPS NMS, so now have 80+ hour save on PS5.",1,1,30
A while ago some youtuber (quill18) was prompted by his subscribers to revisit the game and after watching that video I immediately bought the game.,1,1,25
"Everything is as close to reality as possible, I perfectly understand what I'm talking about, since ",1,1,16
"I myself am engaged in sports shooting, I am interested in equipment, I know the PD, the special forces system, and so on.",1,1,23
I am a huge fan of building and management games. ,1,1,10
"therefore, after watching this game is trailer on youtube, I bought it without hesitation.",1,1,14
 they have been pushing out amazing updates that got me returning to check it out here or there.,1,1,18
" like, still, 30 hours is crazy for how little content there is, and how much enjoyment I got out of it, make more if it!",1,1,25
"I received this game from a friend of mine, it is fully worth the money as I would gladly return it and spend my own money on it in a heartbeat.",1,1,31
I saw a YouTube video talking about how it got better after a while and ,1,1,15
"added it to my Wishlist, then I finally bought it a couple days ago.",1,1,14
 well over 1100 hrs played.,1,0,5
"I love the art,  the content is awesome",1,1,8
"Loved this game, so complete",1,1,5
", but I love the art,  the content is awesome",1,1,10
 the people are never typically in the same spots which I love that about it so that it always will pose a challenge.,1,1,23
Most maps are challenging and,1,1,5
"Not a sworn officer, but this is what I believe is the most realistic CQC simulation I've ever played. ",1,1,19
"Been in since founding and each major update is significant, thoughtful and intelligently addresses existing concerns.",1,1,16
"pick up a person and swing them around with your mouse, watch as you let them go (they actually get dizzy and feel sick) hahaha - it is the lovely little things that count.",1,1,34
 Spooky mode is awesome during this festive season.,1,1,8
"The game can be really easy (and kid-friendly in normal mode, cooperative play with a parent) or",1,1,17
" it can be really very challenging and interesting if one chooses to make it so (survival or ""permadeath"" mode, avoiding exploits).",1,1,21
"The game is definitely worth playing for sure, and ",1,1,9
"you need to keep this in your Wishlist if you are a big fan of tactical, coop-based shooters.",1,1,18
"While currently there is not a ton of maps, they are all fun to explore for the first time and then ",1,1,21
try over and over again to get an S rank.,1,1,10
", and talking with other people in VR is quite the unique experience.",1,1,13
"as someone who use to own theme hospital on physical CD-ROM long ago, ",1,1,13
its insanely cool how not only the formula of that game has been brought into the modern era but also a new spin on the setting such as campus life.,1,1,30
"I have spent an embarrassing amount of time playing two point hospital and the old theme hospital. Starting two point campus, the formulae are already familiar ",1,1,26
and the general interface is very similar.,1,1,7
I know you want you're game to be realistic.,1,0,9
"If you want to play a game where you can shoot innocents, kamikaze your teammates or even rig doors to explode on approach then this is the game for you!",1,1,30
yet seem like it belongs in the present thanks to visuals and added online capabilities,1,1,15
"it has managed to stream-line the simulation/tycoon style gameplay, stick true to the original format (theme hospital) and ",1,1,18
" even when everything falls apart, everyone can share some laughs.",1,1,10
It holds a lot of similarities to Payday 2 in the sense of playing it with friends. There are a variety of ways you can approach each situation and,1,1,29
"Playing with friends in cooperative multiplayer mode is the best way to experience the game, as players can work together and come up with new strategies.",1,1,26
"reading from other gamers that this is a spiritual successor to theme hospital, I gave it a try. it turns out that they are saying the truth after all. ",1,1,29
"The community is great, helpful, and wants nothing but to learn from one another.",1,1,14
"The game's music and sound design are also top-notch, ",1,1,9
creating an immersive and engaging experience that draws you in and keeps you playing for hours on end.,1,1,18
"there is a lot of community for it, on reddit, YouTube, discord, and the game is own forums, where you can find strategy guides, tips and people to work with on online projects to unlock additional items.",1,1,37
This game has the potential to be what metaverse couldn't. I really loved the base building option which gives you infinite level of creative freedom.,1,1,25
This game is pretty good ,1,1,5
this is a good game to play while relaxing in front of television since it only really requires a mouse to play and only about half of your attention.,1,1,29
 from the developers which really shows that they love the product they've created and the community that supports them.,1,1,19
"Very fun game, exceeds expectations year after year with continued FREE updates",1,1,12
Excellent tactical simulation of an alternate universe where police actually use their militarization to stop crimes instead of waiting outside of elementary schools as they're being shot up.,1,1,28
I've played 77 hours so far and,1,1,7
" I have only left my starting solar system twice, maybe 3 times.. . and I still feel like I haven't explored a hundredth of even that.",1,1,26
without losing your progress.,1,1,4
Not really any bugs which is surprising for an early access game.,1,1,12
"Now, nearly 5 years after the launch, the developers have added new aliens, base building, unique starships, multiplayer, virtual reality, and so much more into the game. ",1,1,27
100% worth the money.,1,1,4
"This game is no longer the dud everyone said it was at launch, it has not become one of the best open world games out today.",1,1,26
", but I like the game, ",1,1,6
"Ready or Not was released on December 17, 2021, as an Early Access game. I was very excited for this game and pre-ordered the Supporter Edition through VOID Interactive.",1,1,29
at making the players feel nervous and tense as well as ,1,1,11
The developers have done an awesome job ,1,1,7
making them feel like every choice they make could lead to the mission failing as quickly as it begun.,1,1,19
"the random events are always a pleasure and  like finding people infiltrating the school, random in-game catastrophes all add to the liveliness of the game.",1,1,25
adding a little interactive gameplay,1,1,5
"The visuals and geography of planets are naturally cinematic, play enough and ",1,1,12
you’ll find yourself in camera mode every 5min to capture an amazing view you found.,1,1,15
"realistic scenarios and different scenarios such as hostage rescue, bomb threat, active shooter, barricade enemies and raids.",1,1,17
"When you leave gravity behind and float in space looking for your first expedition to an unknown planet, the feeling that this game captures is almost dreamlike.",1,1,27
I want to reiterate I am still having a lot of fun with this game ,1,1,15
wow I feel immersed most of the time in the game. ,1,0,11
you learn quickly to take things slowly so check every door go slow     wedge doors behind you ect ect. its done that perfectly. nothing else lol.,1,0,26
All that matters is the fun and excitement! ,1,1,8
"Give the game a chance, test ""Ready or Not"" for 2 hours and when you not okay or like the game with the Alpha/Early access",1,1,25
Crazy realistic swat vibes that really has never been done before; the game has a lot of detail along with the fact that it feels like you are a swat member absolutely NUTS,1,1,33
"I have gotten absorbed in game for hours. However, I have come to the conclusion that it is intended to let people experience what ADHD is really like: “I need parafinium for this project.",1,1,34
I like that it feels very realistic and it's very fun. ,1,1,11
There was a time when I used a breaching shotgun and a trap exploded and it killed me and a teammate and all of us were laughing.,1,1,27
"I originally played this game on PS4 and it was fantastic, it captured the feel of swinging from the old Spider-Man 2 game while also having the combat from the Arkham games.",1,1,32
it captured the feel of swinging from the old Spider-Man 2 game ,1,1,12
while also having the combat from the Arkham games.,1,1,9
"it is an amazing, hilarious game with many aspects to  it and is partly educational ",1,1,15
amzing graphics and audio would recommend this game. Could play it for days if I could!,1,1,16
amzing graphics would recommend this game.,1,1,6
amzing audio ,1,1,2
"it is similar to planet coaster or zoo tycoon in regards to building attractions, or in the case a hospital. ",1,1,20
"Mosty you have to play alone, or you just also leave because you are alone: I like to play and finish it, mostly I survive alone. Because I’m have this thing called patience. ",1,1,33
"No hardcore grinding, no survival stress, and EVERYTHING IN IT IS FUN. ",1,0,12
"Flying is fun, dog fights are fun, missions are fun,",1,0,10
" different weapon effects are fun,",1,0,5
 and even trading is fun.,1,0,5
"On to the dialog/voice acting€¦ For the species within the NMS universe (Gek, Korvax, Vy€™Keen, Travelers, and Anomaly), I think that the audio for them was well matched.",1,1,28
"the controls are simple as it can get. the more and more you get use to the game, the more and more you unlock different things to keep your gameplay interesting and fun !",1,1,34
"The No Man's Sky of today is a complete experience, one that I must recommend any and all connoisseurs of the Sci-Fi genre or video games in general should experience at least once.",1,1,33
The process of upgrading your gear is a lot better now with the plethora of upgrades that exist that you can buy with nanites at both space station and the space anomaly.,1,1,32
"There is not a ton of high action content, unless you specifically seek it out (which is fine for me), but there is the occasional space & planet combat encounters that happen naturally.",1,1,33
"This new Waypoint dlc, will say I was excited ",1,0,9
a pretty fun game to play alone or with a friend at your side...,1,1,14
Absolutely awesome game feels so real,1,1,6
Absolutely awesome game feels so tense,1,1,6
 love taking photo another planet,1,1,5
best adventure Game,1,1,3
got the game %10 off but it is definitely worth full price.,1,1,12
"I really love this game it is very fun and reminds me of swat 4, well the controls feel nice along with the A.",1,1,24
looks amazing almost no crashes on lower end systems the entire game overall feels good all thought the traps piss me off to a level beyond anything else,1,1,28
 I've ever done I would recommend worth the price,1,1,9
 I being challenging it has good gun play and tons of gear a truly tactical experience I look forward to the future maps and mode selection and ,1,1,27
 I also like that you have to be extra careful when you go into a building because you can die from just a few hits ,1,1,25
i think that the weapon customization are nice,1,1,8
The crafting style and inventory management systems are very visual in a way that looks good but makes them overly complicated and unintuitive. ,1,0,23
the game is fun and the antics keep you wanting to play more,1,1,13
"also they need to add a lot like I mean a lot of weapons, weapons attachment, ammunition variation, operator gears, and also character model and voice variation, ",1,1,27
this game will save the FPS genre,1,1,7
With friends the galaxy feels less empty though.,1,1,8
"You can also select your social or solo options at the start. Co-op was the promised mode from the beginning, and it has been extremely popular along with the expeditions. ",1,1,30
"For people who have found regular sessions of NMS difficult to get into, expeditions have been much easier. They are far more linear and goal-based, and some have described it as feeling like a different game entirely. ",1,1,37
You can learn alien language and ,1,1,6
sit back and watch the TK's  happen as you try clear the level. (if you are playing with your friends try this out to make the raids more fun),1,1,29
"The shoddy walking simulator with plastic looking planets has been replaced with a universe full of lush planets, disturbing anomalies, vibrant oceans, and so much more. ",1,1,26
"With every major update, . . No Man's Sky has come so unbelievably far from the state in launched in that its become an entirely different game. ",1,1,27
Hello Games proves that this game has changed from a commercial flop to a genuine labor of love.,1,1,18
"Alone, but never lonely, as the interactions with the fauna (like feeding them)and the NPCs in various places that buy and sell and ",1,1,23
"such likes is plenty when you are not out exploring on foot or tucked away in your ship, arcing around another planet for more asteroids to mine. ",1,1,27
"This is the first software example of classic science fiction that lets you, via the massive sandbox processes employed, be a full part of the story as it develops.",1,1,29
Although there is a limit of how much you can bring with your kit that is because this game rely's in cooperation with the rest of your team. ,1,1,28
best game ever (metal),1,1,4
Fought over credits with my best friend travelled far ,1,1,9
and wide learned from and made friends with an alien race built more ship parts travelled more star systems life is good so with that  ,1,1,25
"remember this never be cruel never be cowardly and if you do make amends always laugh, run when you need to never eat pears {they're too mushy} always try to be nice but never fail to be kind And most of all stay true to yourself",1,1,46
i have got all the stars and all teh achievements and enjoyed the game.,1,1,14
if a sim-style game interests you then you should definitely give this a go!,1,1,14
its a very fun game with many hospitals to play in and explore new machines,1,1,15
"The AI is challenging yet fair,",1,1,6
 and gameplay/gunplay feels great.,1,1,4
"This game is like taking the best parts of Pokémon (going around to planets trying to find and identify all the plants and animals), ",1,1,24
" any number of resource management games, space trade and combat like Eve,",1,1,12
"Minecraft (digging and building on planet surfaces, exploring environments), ",1,1,9
 a story driven single player RPG and multiplayer lobby games where people can team up for more difficult content cooperatively.,1,1,20
Watched a suspect get up and punch my friend in the back of the head 10/10,1,1,16
"Two point hospital is a great casual game you are able to simply turtle through while enjoying the comedy unfold throughout crisp, clean graphics.",1,1,24
" the simplified aspects make gameplay much smoother, compared to games like project hospital which can leave you running to a wiki or forums to figure out what device you need to add to what room, in order to treat a given disease. ",1,1,42
"yes ... you may challenge yourself to get a few extra stars (candy)  no need to strain yourself! It is part of the trend toward games of reward versus games of consequence and I really dislike this trend. While the old version is a tool packaged as a game, this version is just pure entertainment. If you want that ... go for it.",1,0,63
but there are no consequences if you fail. just play the next level and have fun ... right?,1,0,18
"Standard advice: do yourself a favor: change your ""review type"" to ""positive only"".",1,1,13
"A friend of mine recently begged, wheedled, cajoled, and begged some more for me to try it. ",1,1,17
"He promised the game had changed, that it wasn't the hot mess it had been at launch. I... have to admit that it looked good.",1,1,25
"Also, part of this expedition's structure makes it a bit like solving a puzzle: many tasks provide rewards for completion that are perfectly suited to working on another one, but they are not necessarily lined up in the ideal order, which means that the best approach is to consider your objectives against each other and devise your own course through them.",1,1,61
"an incredibly worthy spiritual successor to theme hospital, in keeping with the same sense of humour, but with a hundred quality of life and general gameplay improvements.  If you are too young to remember theme hospital; ",1,1,36
the radio djs being identifiable takes on various UK station hosts like sir terry Wogan (bbc) and alice cooper (planet rock) is also an underappreciated stroke of genius.,1,1,28
Great game if you are looking to explore the universe and discover it at your own pace.,1,1,17
"healthcare is probably a joke in your country, so you should feel right at home.",1,1,15
"I prefer to play with a controller, but the keyboard is not hard to get used to.",1,1,17
I was having a lot of fun with the game making video is for my YouTube channel.,1,1,17
"In addition to its exploration and crafting, ",1,1,7
" No Man's Sky also boasts an engaging storyline that will keep you invested in your journey. As you travel through the universe, you will encounter a variety of alien species, each with their own culture and history. By learning about these civilizations, you can uncover the secrets of the universe and unlock the game's many hidden treasures.",1,1,57
" I think this game is about the sense of scale of the whole thing and if you do see someone else's planet, it’s pretty cool, I have named my planets 2dgamemania.co.uk so people can contact me if they see my planet.",1,1,41
"It’s kind of cool how you can name planets, animals etc after you which I have, I know its doubtful someone will see my planet, but you never know.",1,1,29
"Loving it so far, just got to get used to the flight stuff. Got motion sick as hell",1,1,18
The AI has gotten A LOT BETTER and more realistic ,1,1,10
"The community of players surrounding the game are a breath of fresh air, as well. Where a large volume of other games focuses on destruction, competition, and are generally rife with ""toxicity, "" ",1,1,33
"the NMS fan-base is overwhelmingly made up of players who want to build for the sake of building, help for the sake of helping, and share for the sake of sharing.",1,1,31
and the gameplay is immersive.,1,1,5
The level design is fantastic,1,1,5
the guns have punch,1,1,4
The only use I found for it is using it in photo mode for pretty sci-fi space pictures.,1,0,18
"This game is so realistic,",1,1,5
 it’ll leave you unable to breath just like George Floyd.,1,1,10
"Very enjoyable, easy to get to know and play.",1,1,9
VR option: I like that there is a VR option for when I'm in the mood to put on my headset.,1,1,21
"fun simple, interactive game where you put your managing skills to test and see if you can develop a systematic way of approaching different aspect of what necessary to run your hospital, ",1,1,32
at the moment its relatively quite simple without overspending to get what done but I am looking forward to seeing higher difficulty of this game.,1,1,25
goofy diseases and even more goofy ways to cure them will make you wonder what will happen next.,1,1,18
"Had it preordered, had the same experience as everyone else, ",1,1,10
now I cannot stop playing it!!!,1,1,6
healthcare is a terrifying and confusing thing but two point hospital also makes it fun.,1,1,15
which I like since I enjoy designing more and being able to play around with the campus than worrying about affording it all the time.,1,1,25
"I am not a big micromanager, but I rarely have issues with money or getting to three stars. ",1,1,18
"I had preordered the game because it looked so awesome. and when this game works, it is awesome.",1,0,18
"if you like Astroneer or Satisfactory or Subnautica, I highly recommend this game to you.",1,1,15
"is it as good at tph? No. When two point campus was announced I was cautiously optimist,  and for the most part, I was pleasantly surprised. the game uses the same style as two point hospital but the mechanics behind the scenes are very different.",1,1,45
what is not to like about the developers behind the amazing two point hospital trying something new?,1,1,17
Its vast universe ,1,1,3
and deep crafting system ,1,1,4
are sure to keep players engaged for hours on end.,1,1,10
One thing this game has down is the equipment selection and customization. This works very well.,1,1,16
"so far with my biggest hospital using all available zones there has been none of that. With disasters such as earthquakes, fires, etc. and plenty of events and challenges that pop up, its more interesting than a simple build and run style game. ",1,1,43
The voice overs being nearly identical to the original theme hospital was a nice little touch. ,1,1,16
some very easy beginner levels with more difficult ones thrown in once you progress further.,1,1,15
"The armory, firing range and a quick training scenario to get you familiar with controls.",1,1,15
The game is also gorgeous ,1,1,5
and has a great photo mode for people that enjoy taking screenshots.,1,1,12
"The initial learning curve is high, ",1,1,6
"The main experience of the game is using tactics to your advantage and if you are a CQB fan like me, then you'll find plenty to test in this game, you can play with 4 AI squad mates with a wide arrange of orders, or you can team up with some buddies through match making or inviting some of your own peeps over to play, fairly simple.",1,1,67
Who would have thought a 58-year-old grandmother would become a No Man's Sky avid player!,1,1,15
"but also the vague and ominous portends of unnamed voices, whispering about travellers and sentinels and number sequences. ",1,1,18
"You are guided on this journey not only by helpful tutorial messages, ",1,1,12
"I do like that the radio announcer is Mark Silk, who did the black and white 'good and evil' voices.",1,0,20
"Also, every time the state of your suit is updated your suit has a voice that tells you your status. It's nice the first few times and it's useful for the visually impaired,",1,1,33
"Build a full pre-story galaxy that truly sets us up for our travels with an immersive story, species and background where we learn, that for some reason many explored parts of the universe are barren or are becoming barren THEN let us loose to save/civilize that universe ONLY to find out we're in some machine.",1,0,55
"Enemies and NPCs are very symbolic, ",1,0,6
Extremely fun to play with friends while also ,1,1,8
still requiring teamwork and communication/planning skills.,1,1,6
I love the feeling of overcoming the ups and downs of each level to get a smoothly running hospital.,1,1,19
"I own this on my Xbox, (now)Switch, and PC because I have played it throughout the years so often",1,1,19
I do get that quite often I would of brought up civilians running away from you at gunpoint but I'm aware that's gonna be patched in the January update.,1,1,29
", why did you get me addicted this hard?",1,1,9
I’m ashamed to admit I played this for 16 hours straight,1,1,11
 the game also prevents boredom by allowing you to unlock 3 stars on every single hospital.,1,1,16
"it does a great job of starting with the basics of two point hospital, but then building off of them... just to go that one step further. the gameplay is smooth, the comical puns still remain in the game, and there are tons of levels to explore.",1,1,47
it’s actually strangely enjoyable and will eat your hours away without setting a stop playing alarm lol,1,1,17
"My son is now three, and today we sat down and played around in the latest version of No Man is Sky. I realise this game is a masterpiece now I can view it through the eyes of my son, and suddenly it makes sense on a whole new level, and inspires both of us in different ways ",1,1,58
"but most of all, we can enjoy it together.",1,1,9
Ready or Not is a first-person shooter game ,1,1,8
"that truly stands out in terms of advanced AI, realistic graphics, weapons, sound design, and difficulty. ",1,1,16
"The game immerses players in a highly detailed and believable world, where they must navigate through a variety of obstacles and enemies while fighting to survive.",1,1,26
"Sure, you'll still need to grind a little for resources in the first few hours, but once the game opens up and you start making money, exploring different solar systems, , it's pure dopamine. building your own base (a mobile Freighter base is now fully implemented",1,1,46
 thanks to the Endurance update!) it's pure dopamine.,1,1,8
 but the exploration and sandbox aspect can be enticing.,1,1,9
This game is a work of artistic expression that puts you in the shoes of a SWAT officer following protocol in high-risk high-pressure situations. ,1,1,24
"The attention to detail, realism, and a willingness to explore some of the darkest recesses of society and privatized local government violence is impressive.",1,1,24
 considering the AI in the game is pretty advanced and suspects have the ability to surprise you from all sorts of angles.,1,1,22
"Unless your game mode is bomb threat, always take your time and look through everything to make sure It's 100% clear, because you genuinely never know when suspects will flank you and kill you,",1,1,34
"Very enjoyable, and there are also amazing mods out there for it to customize it to your preferences.",1,1,18
"When you land on a derelict freighter random people can also land on it and join your group. If your Setting is set to ""Allow Group and Friends can do X"" you will get some interesting results. ",1,0,37
"you could play as a galactic photographer, taking pictures across the universe. I enjoy this sort of play.",1,1,18
"Great design, Great ideas, and ",1,0,5
"had issues when I first picked up this game. per developers troubleshooting, I excluded folders from antivirus, re-installed graphics card, and re-verified game files. spent almost an hour in game and it no longer crashes and seems to be running smooth. am now a happy gamer again.",1,1,47
"I also don't hear often people talking about the sound FX, the sound in this game is so immersive and well done.",1,1,22
"i did some research and discovered two point games is made up of developers from bullfrog games, the creators of the original theme hospital which is basically the same game we are playing here. ",1,1,34
"This is also the first game brought out by two point games and seeing the reviews, its pretty dang good!!",1,1,20
"I had reviewed this game as one of the best tactical FPS games, and I wasn't wrong at all, ",1,1,19
"this game keeps getting better and better, I didn't just buy this game to play, I did it to support the ambitious developer team behind this game which refused men in black suits to control them.",1,1,36
I would like to figure out how to fly on the PC with a joystick. The freedom it allows is also an aspect I enjoy.,1,1,25
 it auto saves so it should only set you back about ten mins,1,1,13
"it’s humorous, the radio is addictive in the background, ",1,1,9
easy to control via steam controller.,1,1,6
"challenging enough, ",1,1,2
"that is even better in virtual reality, especially with the HTC Vive.",1,1,12
"Overall, No Man's Sky is a fantastic game ",1,1,8
" the puns are ""lol""; and the random ""missions"" that pop up will keep you on your toes.",1,1,17
the graphics are wonderful;,1,1,4
"The rewarding team play, and complexity of the task involved is an immense sense of satisfaction to navigate.",1,1,18
the game itself isn't that bad.,1,0,6
This game provides a very strategic and tactical first-person experience and is very intensive and enjoyable.,1,1,16
Trying to find that 'perfect spot' for your base is a great metaphor for life when you have infinite choices,1,1,20
very easy to follow and learn. ,1,1,6
have put 8 hours in just two days and plan on putting in at least 100 more.,1,1,17
"There have been some recent updates that add more fun into the game with custom outfits and even a Halloween themed update with patients walking around with jack-o-lanterns on their head, decorations and Halloween themed music. that was an unexpected surprise and I love it.",1,1,45
each player has to communicate effectively and bring the most value out of them. ,1,1,14
"One operator can bring 1 primary weapon, 1 sidearm, some grenades and equipment, and a special gadget. The special gadget slot dictates which role that player is.",1,1,27
"Highly recommend you play in VR. And yes, it will work with the HTC Vive Cosmos. Try going at light speed in VR -3-",1,1,24
"Your health is not forgiving, and you need to take control of your situation quickly with wits and reflexes.",1,1,19
"I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side. Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, one handed while I recovered.",1,1,56
"if you ever age out of playing or decide to be more casual, then Dota 2 has an esports scene that rivals IRL sports.",1,1,24
" and yes, it is worth your money.",1,1,7
"incidentally, the movies was developed by one half of the original developer of theme hospital, who went with peter Molyneux to form lionhead studios after EA shuttered bullfrog).this game is worthy of the term ""spiritual successor"",",1,1,36
"I've also played games such as Star Citizen, and Elite Dangerous specifically, so I do have experience playing space sims.",1,1,20
Jumping into a lobby with a fun group of strangers really can make this game really enjoyable to play for hours on end.,1,1,23
"fun social aspect with friends too (if you have any, I do not)",1,1,13
"nice sim, slowly eases you into all the systems perfectly, ",1,1,10
"One feature that I like in the game is the ability to watch a teammates body camera. It's useful because if the two of you are lost, you can watch the camera and locate your partner. ",1,1,36
a sandbox mode with everything unlocked would be good too.,1,1,10
"The chatter not only serves as a essential gameplay elements that forces the player to quickly process info from other teammates and quickly give clear, direct reports to others",1,1,29
", it also create a very realistic atmosphere, you really feel like and work like as a team.",1,1,18
"The freedom to embark on perilous voyages, trade resources, and upgrade equipment brings a rewarding sense of progress.",1,1,18
there are many random events ,1,1,5
"To sum up, I love this game and it is company and",1,1,12
"Unique game implementation (half online half offline, local save but server side discoveries and bases etc. ) , editing of local saves don't affect other players.",1,1,26
you build your hospitals up to meet simple goals in a light hearted world with a cute sense of humour and that is it.,1,1,24
"you can explore quintillions of galaxy, buy new ships, build bases, and own a fleet in this amazing space game.",1,1,20
"A shoot house and firing range are available to test and run the various weapons and equipment to get familiarity, hours can be spent simply learning the game mechanics and weapon mechanics in the Ready Room to better understand the game.",1,1,41
an AI that is difficult because it's good and not just because of reaction time etc.,1,1,16
"Good this is Hello Games is still working hard at it, so wherever it still lacks, I'm sure issues will be solved by the developer.",1,1,25
"Graphics are super nice, and ",1,1,5
this game probably has the best feeling weapons I have seen in a game as well as gun shot noises too.,1,1,21
that I recently binged and I cannot recommend it enough.,1,1,10
I bought this game after watching outside Xbox is videos covering it ,1,1,12
"I enjoyed it immensely and put in a lot of time, making it I believe my highest play time game on Steam as of writing this. ",1,0,26
I've got all the achievements but ,1,0,6
 but the community has a controller layout that does a great job of mapping the key bindings.,1,1,17

"keep in mind that I finished it here and a ps5 while still playing and  on a ps4 version so yeah, fun.",1,1,22
gathering trophies and platinumed on ,1,1,5
lots of facilities have been added from the last instalment on the PlayStation 1.,1,1,14
 it is a refreshing start to a reboot which features lots of cool modes and environments on how to play and manage a simulation hospital game. ,1,1,26
Recommended!,1,1,1
"some of the puzzles are a bit complicated, but everything manageable if you just try.",1,1,15
playing with the character and moving it around the room makes everything more immersive and ,1,1,15
the sound effects puts you in the right place every single time.,1,1,12
"the game looks great, runs great and plays great.",1,1,9
"it is just like theme hospital, but it also manages to have it is own personality that while obviously influenced by the bullfrog classic is still distinct enough to not feel like a rip off.",1,1,35
"The gameplay is not too varied (clearing rooms and areas) but still exciting and tense because of the realistic damage (~3shots == dead), ",1,1,23
"This is not only a first-person shooter game with already a large arsenal of weapons and very detailed customization,",1,1,19
 but also a strategy game with compelling maps that tell stories of why you're there and what you need to do as a SWAT member.,1,1,25
 it is absolutely amazing 10/10 recommend,1,1,6
two point hospital is a fantastic business simulation game that offers a great variety of characters and environments to manage.,1,1,20
VOID was constantly informing people who pre-ordered the game what was going on and the changes ,1,1,16
I am glad that it’s been released for Early Access / BETA. I’m excited to see what other bits are coming after the game is fully released.,1,1,27
Also the nightclub map is awesome but ,1,1,7
Commanding your AI teammates becomes intuitive pretty quick ,1,1,8
 and watch some twitch/youtube on the other monitor as the cash starts rolling in.,1,1,14
Cheap way to get 80+ hours of entertainment,1,1,8
 I love that managing students is much more interactive than managing patients - ,1,1,13
it feels like the developers heard all the wishes from players in hospital and made them for campus!,1,1,18
and managing staff feels much harder now!,1,1,7
"It teaches team control/communication, and being tactful before just turning a corner",1,1,12
Looking up into the sky and realizing every single one of those stars in the sky is somewhere REAL that you can VISIT baffles me. I love this game. It's beautiful- ,1,1,31
it's wondrous with a sense of exploration nothing has ever given me.,1,1,12
"RoN is very fun to play in co-op even in this state, especially if you manage to find a squad that matches your game style on the very active discord server of the game, but I really think that the best is yet to come for this title.",1,1,48
"The game has a steep learning curve, it's a challenging swat sim that should satisfy hardcore gamers.",1,1,17
"The introduction of multiplayer capabilities has breathed new life into the experience, allowing friends and strangers alike to forge alliances, and ",1,1,21
"engage in epic space battles, ",1,1,5
construct shared bases across the cosmos.,1,1,6
 installing and upgrading technology for your suit/ship/freighter/multitool/exocraft/exomech,1,1,7
"The survival aspect, space combat, owning your own capitol ship, piracy, smuggling, derelict freighters, crashed freighters I can go on and on.",1,1,22
The team’s willingness to show the true horrors of swat while understanding their shaky history with the poor and minorities is refreshing.,1,1,22
but if you are willing to play what’s here right now it should be a good time.,1,1,17
"This feels like a solid very polished game, ",1,1,8
"the gameplay is engaging and varied, from base building to exploring and completing missions etc.",1,1,15
"but look at Fortnite, that childish game is number 1 on twitch most days.",1,1,14
many improvements to AI,1,1,4
A lot of new content is pushed out in every update ,1,1,11
" new guns, many improvements to AI, sound design, ",1,1,8
" incredibly designed and immersive maps with great environmental storytelling, lighting, optimization.",1,1,11
oh and being able to name almost everything yourself in an inspiring mystical science fiction setting.,1,1,16
"a single player with some multiplayer aspects, ",1,1,7
 You can adjust many aspects /settings to your needs and play style.,1,1,12
"as a directive, performance remains at a satisfactory level,",1,1,9
awesome game for early access ,1,1,5
hope one day we can see people on Xbox and PlayStation cross platform I hope this game comes out on Xbox or PlayStation,1,1,23
"Cool story concept,",1,0,3
" and great graphics,",1,0,3
"decent graphics, and really cute, and well thought out vibes, that really make this a fun game to play, and",1,1,20
 just have the best time building away.,1,1,7
"good game culture, community events are a nice touch (keeps the game interesting without having to download an entire new game, but with a reward system), cross-play is like the Switzerland flag; a big plus.",1,1,35
I love this game no one likes it ,1,1,8
there is no gore sex and lots of violence it is gets repetitive but it still very amusing great game for all ages,1,1,23
thought this game would annoy me but I find it enjoyable escape from reality of real hospital work.,1,1,18
special rooms like the deluxe clinic did not show up in sandbox mode.,1,1,13
So vast that it is remotely impossible for one player to accidentally (without use of navigation or maps or waypoints) end up in the same place twice.,1,0,27
"stays fresh with well-paced unlocks,  in strategy and placement. ",1,1,9
"the game is great,",1,0,4
the planets are sometimes so good looking I hardly believe its procedural! and ,1,1,13
the photo mode is really powerful and has great potential don’t sleep on it,1,1,14
"This is a good game with a lot of potential, ",1,1,10
"You feel tense every moment, as you methodically clear room after room, hall by hall wondering in the back of your mind if this next room will be the one you take that one unlucky round right in the eye.",1,1,40
"A first person shooter that is legitimately terrifying and stressful, ",1,1,10
"encourages and rewards teamplay and information based combat, and offers an increasing number of tools to solve situations.",1,1,18
a fun game that doesn't shy away from depicting realistic and tragic real life events for the sake of immersion,1,1,20
 while also having a dedicated and transparent development team in Void Interactive.,1,1,12
"Attention to texturing details is nice (tags and graffiti on the walls, slurs against police and authority in clothing, various details in world objects etc).",1,1,25
"Because of the well thought out map designs and story when you play through the maps. It's not structured as a campaign, but something you progress through and find what happened at the crime scene.",1,1,35
"Due to the hard work and dedication of Hello Games what was the most down voted and negatively reviewed game on Steam now enjoys a ""Mostly Positive"" Rating.",1,1,28
"Edit: The AMD Fidelity option under Graphics | Advanced gets me 60 FPS constant on most maps on Quality setting, definitely worth the lower visual resolution.",1,1,26
"I'm a big fan of Sandbox survivals or exploration base games, I clocked numerous hours in games like Ark Survival, Terreria(not in my steam) ,Starbound and Astroneer.",1,0,27
i used to play the PlayStation game theme hospital,1,1,9
 and this game took everything good about that game and made it better and got rid of some of the things that were annoying in the original.,1,1,27
"I'm 34, I'm old and demanding and I really can't afford to start playing at 5 pm only to end at 2:30 am, wondering, how the hell I'm going to wake up for work (which I did yesterday, thanks to NMS).",1,1,41
very good stability and performance! ,1,1,5
I really like this idea and how much I can do in this game.,1,1,14
"it has all the good qualities of two point hospital but has its own personality, great humor ",1,1,17
"Just like LoL, Dota 2 is gaining success throughout its competitive e-sport scene, and",1,1,14
 it's clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position. ,1,1,12
lots of fun creating your own hospital. ,1,1,7
"making decisions, that have fun consequences. ",1,1,6
funny dialogue and interactions from the non-player character characters.,1,1,9
"No Man's Sky (NMS) is a vast, detailed, atmospheric, sci-fi galaxy that ",1,1,12
"still knows it's a GAME and is firmly focused more on ""fun-per-hour"", than trying to be the perfect simulation.",1,1,19
Ready or Not gives me adrenaline rushes no game has before with ,1,1,12
"how quickly encounters can change, from calm manoeuvring to entry points, to enemies suddenly popping off rounds down the hallway.",1,1,20
"Really good game considering that it's still in alpha,",1,1,9
when you are playing with friends you still have a good time.,1,1,12
"Surviving Edged Weapons taught me a lot of valuable stuff, I was astounded that this game is very close to what the video taught me. Unprecedented realism, combined with good old SWAT 4 fun.",1,1,34
"the building mechanics are snappy and easy to use (even if small things do not like to line up perfectly), and",1,1,21
 you have a great deal of control over your campus.,1,1,10
the game is very realistic and fun and ,1,1,8
"To me, no man sky is like Minecraft, a very large pool, very large, but really shallow. Don’t get me wrong, the game is awesome and I enjoy so much of what I played, it was totally worth it.",1,1,39
"with two point hospital you get to play this similar game but much more improved and with new objectives, diseases, maps.... I really enjoy playing it and I know I will finish it completely.",1,1,34
All in all VOID interactive has done a wonderful job with progressing this game and if they keep ,1,1,18
it up will potentially have one of the best tactical FPS we have ever seen.,1,1,15
the creators have to make money or else they couldn't continue developing this amazing game.,1,1,15
An incredibly good feeling co-op tactical shooter experience ,1,1,8
An incredibly authentic feeling tactical shooter experience ,1,1,7
 almost perfectly represents the tense environments and quick decision making of police and SWAT engagements.,1,1,15
"building the hospital is fun, a lot of fun, but once you make it, ",1,0,14
have AMD with above recommended hardware.,1,0,6
even though I am a designer by profession and passion,1,1,10
", I find that I still manage to struggle with the design of environmental places and how to story-tell within a space.",1,1,22
"had my reservations, but it is actually pretty good! All of the goodness of the original, with extra added details.",1,1,20
 Staff and patients interact with damn near every object you plop down.,1,1,12
had to support the developers and buy the full game,1,1,10
"i put dozens of hours into this game on Xbox game pass for pc, ",1,1,14
it is so worth your time/money if you are into tycoon/building games.,1,1,12
 a modernized version of bullfrog is old classic theme hospital from some of the same developers.,1,1,16
"I wish all games that labled themselves ""spiritual successor"" were this good.",1,1,12
"I'd recommend for anyone honestly, ",1,1,5
the single player can be a fun way to learn the game ,1,1,12
and then you can either get your friends to buy it also or join a public lobby!,1,1,17
"New to tactical shooters and was able to play perfectly fine as well unlike games like squad where you need to have a lot of playtime to get decent, but squad is pvp tho so makes sense",1,1,37
"Now after it has been out a few years, I have to say everything seems so well polished, very few bugs, and ",1,1,22
I feel like they truly delivered on and endless and unique space to explore.,1,1,14
"Player community is also creative and active, you can get pretty many MOD that could make your game experience better or provide more challenging one, even some beautiful maps included.",1,1,30
The game is massive and beautiful  ,1,0,6
"The worlds are gorgeous, ",1,1,4
"the species unique, the ships totally varied, and no matter what, you can and will always have a different story in the game than anyone else.",1,1,26
"There is a variety of maps but with mods you can massively increase that. Mod support is good as well with people being able to make all sorts from uniforms, guns, voices, menu mods etc.",1,1,35
"To describe this game in metaphorical sense, it's feels like taking a walk in the late afternoon, passing the hills, fields and coming back home after sundown under a night sky.",1,1,31
You can customize settings for difficulty level if you want more of a challenge or want more of a sandbox and you can even adjust the difficulty during gameplay if you want to.,1,1,33
"You get no intel on what the mission is like, a map of the place and what loadout you should bring, so it's mainly memorizing missions that helps you navigate and prepare correctly.",1,1,33
"If there were 1000 planets, and 1 of them had a lone Giant Squid tucked away in an ocean somewhere, how amazing would it feel to suddenly run into it after 100 hours of gameplay. Or a single planet covered in forest, and suddenly you find a tribe of bigfoot with a fully functioning village tucked away in a valley somewhere? Some things you still would never find. And enough such easter eggs and it could be years before all of them were discovered by the entire player community.",1,0,89
a classic tycoon-style game with wacky and irreverent British humor.,1,1,10
"an absolutely perfect game,",1,1,4
incredibly realistic,1,1,2
"A surprisingly addictive game that gets you into the mind of a SWAT officer, using real CQB tactics and incredibly satisfying weapons to use with most of the fun coming from restrain and using your tools, wits, and clever planning to bring in as many people alive and thus get a higher score and",1,1,54
" no matter how many times you fail its always a learning experience to learn the layout of the building, master the recoil of a gun or just hone your skills in CQB environments really a great game for anyone who wants a game that rewards quick thinking, efficient uses of tactics or a great CO-OP experience plus the modding scene and ",1,1,61
more updates coming along the way means that more is yet to come8.,1,1,13
I enjoyed the radio and p.a.,1,1,6
"music it’s simple, peaceful, calming, yet eerie all at the same time.",1,1,12
"From things like proper use of flashlight (if you light the window from the wrong angle it will blind you), through completely unpredictable behavior of enemies like  faking being dead, faking surrender just to shoot at you when you get close, hiding or taking cover in places",1,1,47
" you will least expect  which makes you stay on your toes the entire time and treat everyone as potential hostile (and the game heavily penalize you for killing someone you were not supposed to), to (graphic warning)  gritty images like child Doing in pink child's room .",1,1,47
It's an extremely detailed tactical SWAT team simulator. ,1,1,8
Lobbies are always populated; the community is very collaborative.,1,1,9
the Xbox one is better.,1,1,5
"Playing it on VR, forgot to shower, forgot to eat.",1,1,10
The company actually fixed their reputation and game.,1,1,8
Very relaxing you can play for hours without even noticing,1,1,10
", and if you upgrade the right pieces of equipment you can make a career out of doing nothing but scanning rare animals on other planets. Or you can become a scrapper, locating wreckage and artifacts using the navigation data you can purchase from the space stations, and make bank pretty quickly. Or you can do a scan for hostile systems, hop to each one and collect high bounties for a living. Or DON'T AT ALL. Units aren't required to have fun in this game, you can just spend your time drifting to the center of the galaxy ",1,1,98
You can make units (the game's currency) by doing just about anything and gather the necessary resources to move on without spending a single unit.,1,1,25
"from lush, verdant worlds teeming with life to desolate, harsh environments that require careful planning and resource management to survive. ",1,1,20
"The sense of discovery and wonder as I uncover new species, resources, and secrets never ceases to amaze me.",1,1,19
"With billions of star systems, each with its own unique planets, flora, and fauna, the possibilities for exploration are virtually endless. I'm constantly amazed by the diverse array of planets I encounter, ",1,1,32
"mentally sane people. Patience is rewarded As you navigate pitch black hallways and rooms armed with nothing but your guns and a flashlight (NVGs are available too), it really can play out like a horror game. ",1,1,36
This game is great,1,1,4
This game is awesome! ,1,1,4
this builds constant sense of anticipation as the player awaits their highest payout of the round and goes long way to make each individual spin maintain sense of excitement even after you have had 20 30 runs of it along with,1,1,41
"the story mode of the game is great, but it is not what everyone wants.",1,1,15
The photo mode is phenomenal and easily what I do with most of my time.,1,1,15
"the ""superbug network"" feature seems pretty cool for people who have friends.it seems to be a shared progress tree that you can invite friends to kinda like how clan progress works in other games but much smaller; ",1,1,37
"example, the first tree allows up to 3 players and each player can work on a different branch on the tree at the same time. ",1,1,25
settings can be easily adjusted to suit the spec of the computer you are using.,1,1,15
 it is a peaceful way to spend a weekend.,1,1,9
it is the perfect orthographic type 3d simulation that I wish there were more of.,1,1,15
In no mans sky you can explore a huge universe ,1,1,10
If you have a couple of friends to play with then this is a really fun experience.,1,1,17
"I support ""VOID Interactive"" and look forward to your company's development.",1,1,11
"I still love the game, and it's such an excitement to watch as an ""e-sport"". ",1,1,15
 forgot to eat and drink water.,1,1,6
"i love two point is games, and it is great so far. ",1,0,12
"Everything dies fast, and when bullets are ripping through walls past your head, or you hear a teammate get pinned down by roaring gunfire on the other side of a hotel, and rush to assist them with a flank- it really gets you into the moment.",1,1,46
"so while the goal is to not end up in them, when they do happen, they really stand out.",1,1,19
" Gunfights are scary, loud, and you feel relieved to have survived, much like I imagine they would be in reality-",1,1,20
"After I preorder the game at 2016 I was disappointed as F, but right now I’m happy as F!",1,1,19
"as we prepare for an intense situation with terrorists that will require extreme concentration and focus I can only think about how I will be able to get back alive. We begin our mission and move towards the entrance door and open it, a trap bomb explodes, killing us all instantly.",1,1,51
I enjoy exploration type games that involve vehicles as they really open up the speed you can explore at. The Roamer being my first vehicle that I upgraded fully is the one I have the most experience with. It was interestingly powerful in some cases; wielding a super powerful mining laser that worked quickly and a power scanning system that made tracking specific structures possible.,1,0,65
I preordered this game because I was so excited for it after playing two point hospital.,1,1,16
"the AI have a certain randomness to their behaviour that keeps most matches interesting, ",1,1,14
"I really like this game, it's a pretty good looking game, every player has a specific role to fill on the team, the only downside is it's currently just you and your team (ai or real players) vs the ai and , and the hostages tend to run away from you every time.",1,1,53
 lots of cute funny characters and hilarious two point radio announcers chatting in the background,1,1,15
 I feel confident recommending this game.,1,1,6
", but if you like management games with a little challenge, a bit more relaxed without a timer, a bit of design",1,1,22
if you are looking for a micromanagement game with a lot of depth to the operation of the scenarios this game may not satisfy as well as some others,1,1,29
"love the catchy music as well, though I kinda wish we could choose which songs to play.",1,1,17
Either way I died quite a few times just trying to learn the mechanics of the game. This was honestly the most fun I had with the game during my time with it. the sense of discovery and me being an idiot actually made it enjoyable.,1,0,46
"The VR is acceptable, ",1,1,4
but playing it sure makes me want to go back to Keyboard and mouse.,1,1,14
"There are a lot of good ideas floating around on modding sites that it would be cool to see officially implemented by Hello Games, but I think it is a totally enjoyable game as is. ",1,1,35
"This game is the prefect bowl moment helper, they say FPS, but this a survivor horror game imo",1,1,18
"This game's story is gripping, fast-paced, action-packed and deep. ",1,1,9
"You'll meet many characters on the way, and you'll have to make difficult decisions. These decisions actually do influence what happens later on in the story, too. Instead of ""Oh, this guy died because of what you did, but ultimately the universe is still saved!"" you can make choices that skew the entire game in negative, or positive, ways.",1,1,59
this is one of those tycoon games that you will buy and binge uncontrollably for days/weeks.,1,1,16
"... explore worlds, interact with aliens, go on missions, commit acts of space piracy, travel the Galaxy, upgrade tech and ships, and make your way to the center of the universe! ",1,1,31
", in doing so you end up learning all about the other parts of the game, you naturally begin to acquire the knowledge and experience that allows you to create the fabled ""Ionised Chicken Egg"" without needing to spend hours on Google.",1,1,42
"no steep learning curve, high skill ceiling,",1,1,7
"Great gun play,  can play causal/dumb or be super milsimy.",1,1,10
 and I can say RON has finally edged out EFT as far as the gun mechanics go.,1,1,17
I am a huge Tarkov fan,1,1,6
"The value is good, you can spend a lot of hours in it!",1,1,13
I highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a fun and challenging SWAT game on Steam.,1,1,18
"I played two point hospital and this is of course similar, but it feels much more polished somehow.",1,1,18
"If you are a fan of sci-fi culture, there are many references to many different movies and stories.",1,1,18
"Maps are varied in size and design, different scenarios is really cool and keeps the game feeling fresh.",1,1,18
"Most everything you can land on in NMS is brightly coloured, has weird animals, crazy storms and bizarre plants. Granted, procedural generation makes things seem a bit samey, but there's a lot of surprises that pop up if you're willing to push a little further (the hexagon ""boundary breach"" planet being a personal favourite).",1,1,54
No Man's Sky is a very true to form depiction of what the Sci-Fi genre was originally all about.,1,0,19
"No Man's Sky is the ultimate virtual vacation destination. Imagine a place where you can explore endless planets, fly through space, and discover new life forms without ever having to worry about pesky things like gravity or oxygen.  And the sense of discovery is unmatched.",1,1,45
The graphics are out of this world (literally),1,1,8
"One of the best games I've played in a while, ",1,1,10
I had this game on my Wishlist since it was a PvP alpha.,1,1,13
Slowly and methodically infiltrate a highly detailed environment that silently reveals a dark story as you attempt to rescue civilians and bring suspects to justice.,1,1,25
 The game will put you on edge as tension builds  It can transform from shoot action game into horror at a moments notice,1,1,23
knowing you can be killed from any single mistake.,1,1,9
"takes a while to get used to the controls, but once you have gotten the hang of it, it is easy to work.",1,1,23
the community work is so appreciated as well,1,1,8
good incentives and beta testing opportunities too.,1,1,7
the player base is decent.,1,1,5
"The game overall is fun, ",1,1,5
"The story was interesting, as I look back on it, but it was a little bit too non linear and overly complicated by the language system, but I did liked the translator and language learning. ",1,1,35
"I do feel like I have experienced a small part space while still nearly completing the story, which may speak to its first play through and dare I say replay ability.",1,1,31
 until I finally got it when they released the NEXT update.,1,1,11
 The debris from the explosions and the bullet impact looks real.,1,1,11
Also the graphics is on point. ,1,1,6
sound design is on point. ,1,1,5
"Futuristic space is an endless well of creativity, variety, and is a massive blank canvas to tell almost any form of meaningful stories in due to its nature. Space pirates with both complex and tragic motivations, cultures and civilizations that are socially/structurally/architecturally diverse and interesting.",1,0,45
"I played this game at launch had some fun, and I picked it up again with my wife a few years ago.",1,0,22
then this game is for you.,1,1,6
"learning more about mysteries of the alien-like world, exploring planets/moons/relicts of the past or conquering all fauna and flora while looking at the sea in your self-built mansion",1,1,28
"If you loving managing your base and colonies, ",1,1,8
" love space trading,",1,1,3
 Of course you can cheat a permadeath defeat by the simple method of backing up your permadeath game file before beginning your play session.,1,0,24
"If you're like me and don't have friends don't worry there is the AI helping you, it's not bad it's not perfect it still needs some work on it and balance, sometimes I feel like I’m just barking orders and not playing sometimes they're in my way but there are those rare times it all goes perfect and smooth.",1,1,59
"it has a very awesome design, with very intense situations,",1,1,10
" as you unlock more items, diseases, and rooms you can go back and build up your previous hospitals, raising them to three star levels in your pursuit of perfection.",1,1,29
"it is a fun game and figuring out how to deal with each new level, tackling every hospital and set of scenarios, is challenging as well as rewarding.",1,1,28
"it plays less like a simulation, and more like a puzzle game, with many of the maps coming in already predetermined boundaries and shapes, and ",1,1,25
"they all have different challenges, such as one that requires radiators to combat the heat, another where you must train student staff into professionals, and many more.",1,1,27
"Its still in alpha, the game still has a long way to go, but the core is there and already it is a lot of fun.",1,1,26
"My favourite part of this game is finding something new and amazing, or finding a new planet with amazing resources, It is like getting to live your dream over and over again in a Groundhog Day, open world environment.",1,0,39
and complete stories filled with bright memorable adventures.,1,1,8
"discover systems full of unexplained mysteries and puzzles,",1,1,8
"No Man's Sky is a unique experience of exploring wide space expanses untouched by human hand where you'll be able to visit planets inhabited by wonderful creatures,  ",1,1,27
overall great game.  had some good times playing it though. grade A,1,1,12
"Profanity continues on. The occasional ""F"" word, and thankfully not much else.",1,1,12
"the developers did a great job of updating the game, and have continued to add significant not quality of life features through free patches - if you played while gps were an issue, you will be happy to see a new policy was added to alleviate that problem, and you can also now set rooms to diagnosis or treatment only.",1,1,60
"The developers seem to be sticking to their word adding new content regularly, and I've been enjoying playing.",1,1,18
"The game's graphics are stunning, with each planet you explore being uniquely crafted and visually striking.",1,1,16
"The interface/interaction controls may take some getting used to, but in my opinion, are laid out sensibly.",1,1,17
"You may get an extra character interaction or two depending on your decisions, wow! ",1,0,14
"A ""throw you in the deep end"" experience where you learn quick and use your head instead of being told what to do.",1,1,23
"The only redeeming factor is Graphics, but that's the thing that plagues every modern games - somehow every management team thinks everybody looks for good graphics and nothing else in a video game.",1,0,33
"As you got through more and more levels, enemies would get more variety and equipment (eg. shotguns, gas masks, ballistic vests). ",1,1,21
"Because there was a progression with difficulty, it made the challenge of the levels scale with how much you were willing to learn/adapt to the situations.",1,1,26
"complex enough where you get to learn how to prioritize, organize and learn ",1,1,13
once again easy enough to casually play.,1,1,7
"Fun, realistic, great to train situational awareness, reaction speed and responsiveness when facing constantly-changing scenarios. ",1,1,15
Really liked adrenaline rush in situations where situations can go from 0 to 100 in mere seconds (e. g. suspects rushing out of door that I was pie-ing),1,1,28
Great tactical gameplay and good matchmaking. ,1,1,6
definitely recommend this game to anyone who enjoys multitasking!,1,1,9
"hilarious themes explored, keeps one entertained, ",1,1,6
"I am amazed by how much these developers have won over my heart after the rocky launch, ",1,1,17
 but after 6 long years the developers are STILL pushing out amazing updates regularly.,1,1,14
"I have been able to achieve a admirable framerate at max settings, ",1,1,12
"I enjoy the core loop, visually pleasing, misses potential for faction space conflicts.",1,1,13
I still rate this as 'recommended' because it is very cool in many ways and I think other players would enjoy it.,1,1,22
"If you're lucky, you are paired up with 4 others in multiplayer where you choose a location and mission type (such as bomb defusal, hostage rescue or barricaded suspects), and work together tactically to complete the mission without loss of life, whether that be you or civilians.",1,1,47
since you actually get to unlock achievements and rewards by just spending a few more hours on the game,1,1,19
giving you that addictive sense of accomplishment that fuels the dopamine reward system of the human brain.,1,1,17
"it is almost like civilization is ""one more turn"" meme, but even better, , ",1,1,14

"Point is communication as you can as easily flash yourself and your team. (No, not that kind of flashing) and ",1,1,20
"friendly fire is a real danger if you don't watch your angles. But if you have a coordinated team, complementing loadouts and walk through it slowly, you can defeat any level.",1,1,31

"on our third mission we forgot to pack flash lights or night vision so we could not find a bag of drugs, the meth heads do a good job hiding there stuff, so next time we know to always bring a flash light.",1,1,43
Some maps or game modes also add-in secondary targets that,1,1,10
 keep the game interesting even if it's on the same map.,1,1,11
"The AI is clever and challenging, making it difficult to predict where the seeker will go next.",1,1,17
" The tension is palpable as I try to avoid being found and eliminated, and ",1,1,14
the satisfaction of winning as a hider or successfully eliminating all the hiders as the seeker is unmatched.,1,1,18

"this game is so funny, from the weird announcements to the weird patient conditions, you also have plenty to do, ",1,1,20
this game somehow makes playing a game during a pandemic not depressing and actually quite fun.,1,1,16
this game somehow makes playing a hospital simulator game and actually quite fun.,1,1,13
while some of the puzzles are solved by random clicking ,1,1,10
there is quite a variety of interesting puzzles to solve.,1,1,10
... Something about exploring new worlds that no one else has seen is just really awesome in my eyes and ,1,1,20
Now with all these new updates the game is just absolutely amazing!,1,1,12
 owning your own planet in your own little corner in the universe is such a cool feeling!,1,1,17
"Amazing, truly an immersive tactical shooter which ",1,1,7
plays on both your ability to cooperate and make split second decisions.,1,1,12
"As a HUGE side note for me, it contains nothing morally questionable that would keep me from being able to let my kids play it.",1,1,25
"From The Anomaly you can interact with other players, scan their sweet rides, chat it up, purchase upgrades for everything you may need in the deep darkness of space, talk to a space version of Gordon Ramsay and feed him your prepared dishes, and many other things.",1,1,47
" I thought this might get boring after a while, but due to various different classes and so many little details to explore throughout the game it has not gotten boring yet.",1,1,31
funny campus-build game just like two point hospital or the original theme hospital.,1,1,13
good game with a lot of potential ,1,1,7
so far I can comfortably say this game is very impressive for an early access game.,1,1,16
I have hundreds of hours logged in this game,1,0,9
This game is actually simulating our current energy crisis in Europe lol,1,1,12
"Multiplayer on Multiplayer mode your can join with your save, get benefits from your save ",1,1,15
"No Man's Sky (NMS) tries to make everything as easy as possible, and finds ways to make the game steadily easier if you want it.",1,1,25
"No Man's Sky also features an online multiplayer mode, allowing players to join forces and explore the universe together.",1,1,19
seems to be a huge success since it will be available even for Nintendo switch soon.,1,1,16
perfect for theme hospital veterans :-),1,1,6
"Story is sparse and cryptic but has some interesting elements. Not enough to justify playing the game for story, but it can make normally mundane missions slightly more interesting, with a decently short main story and branching infinite side missions.",1,1,40
This game is by far the best tactical shooter I have played bar none. ,1,1,14
"The game mechanics are so in-depth while being fairly intuitive after a couple of live playthrough or some training on the range, which make for a challenging but manageable learning curve.",1,1,31
This is probably the best exploration slash survival game out their in general and almost certainly bar none in the sci-fi genre.,1,1,22
"two point hospital is a fun game to play, especially in sandbox mode ",1,1,13
with custom music and content from the steam workshop.,1,1,9
Could be interesting in VR as well. . . . . possibly in future. . ?,1,1,16
Very realistic and looking forward to future development. ,1,1,8
"you can tell that this is not an English game as they offer private tutoring as ""private tuition"" and as a current college student, it makes me laugh a bit to get notifications stating my students completed their ""tuition session"". all in all, fun game.",1,1,45
"every sim game starts out predictable, ",1,1,6
but two point hospital has a strategy that has depth and fun rarely found over long lengths of time.,1,1,19
I want to state my undying respect for Hello Games for their work on NMS.,1,0,15
"Games improved like crazy, almost the exact game they promised before, obviously peoples imagination went too crazy on launch. ",1,1,19
"I did and this game is that imagined game come to fruition! You will build, mine, create, fly, negotiate and hunt down mysterious signals in the single player mode. If story is not your bag, you can just play creative which has zero story, just play.",1,1,46
" on my ps4 playthrough, and I am looking forward to being able to play this even more now that we have a new computer.",1,1,24

 join the Ready Or Not discord and find some peeps to play with.,1,1,13
I would highly recommend you play this game with some friends in voice chat or,1,1,15
"It can be a relaxing experience with fairly good immersion, nice and colorful and ",1,0,14
photo mode-worthy graphics/panoramas and ,1,0,4
even the background story/narrative although only mostly told in text doing same-ish chores over and over again isn't too bad.,1,0,20
"It had absolutely fantastic procedural generation tech alongside an evocative, vibrant artstyle, and if what you wanted to do was fly around a galaxy, taking photos of fantastic landscapes and creatures, then this was everything that you could want.",1,1,39
It is much better suited to mouse play with enough changes that it is not the same. ,1,1,17
I think it is a fantastic version of the old classic.,1,1,11
sandbox mode gives you different difficulty levels to start. ,1,1,9
"personally, I even think 2pc is more challenging than 2ph. Generally I see so much potential with two point games.",1,1,20
"I’m not good with words, I think this is a game you need to try out yourself.",1,1,17
this being said I do enjoy the rantings of the several radio host personalities on display.,1,1,16
"The fact that this game is ""Early Access"" and still feels more complete than ""finished"" AAA titles",1,1,17
" like Battlefield 2042, COD Vanguard, etc.",1,1,6
There are some good things about this game which you can read about online,1,0,14
the game starts nice and easy and then ramps into a completely hard-core management sim.,1,1,15
"when I saw how fine-grained I could get with management, it had my attention. ",1,1,14
"when I heard that ex-bullfrog staff were producing tph, it had my curiosity. ",1,1,13
"The base game is great and really shows off the games basic form, ",1,1,13
all downloadable content is are positive additions that are all well worth it.,1,1,13
"As the game progresses, players must handle a variety of challenges, such as managing staff morale, treating complex illnesses, and upgrading their facilities.",1,1,23
one of the strengths of two point hospital is its sense of humor.,1,1,13
yet it pays you back with the amount of awesome content you can unlock ,1,1,14
and make/explore with friends.,1,1,4
"Basically, in short, it's a very fun space game with a decent amount of strategy when it comes to resource management early-game, ",1,1,22
"Now that public service message is out of the way, I can safety say I love this game it really is a trip down memory lane!",1,1,26
"Good job to the Hello Games team for giving consumers most of the content that was in the trailer, ",1,0,19
"I always liked tycoon games, and this is one of the best I have played lately.",1,1,16
"it is a lot of fun, and keeps you going for hours with the story progression. All the small and funny details are a must and make the game even more enjoyable.",1,1,32
advise getting the game if you only have one other person to play it with ,1,1,15
There is a good variety of maps now; not just massive ones and the house.,1,1,15
Lots of tongue in cheek humor that keeps the laughs coming while enjoying the gameplay. ,1,1,15
the mini-dlcs you  add to the flavor as well.,1,1,9
get from twitch,1,1,3
"My soul is complete, and I cannot wait to see what else its gonna bring,",1,1,15
 I am nothing but hopeful and eager to see what this dev team brings us.,1,1,15
"No man's sky brings the fun of exploring a simple, procedurally generated galaxy without too many strings attached, s",1,1,19
SO many updates ,1,1,3
" its like Minecraft on steroids, in Space!",1,1,7
"and so much to explore and interact with,",1,1,8
 and a cryptic story to slowly explore;,1,1,7
"The game's environments are highly detailed and realistic, with a wide variety of textures and lighting effects that really bring the world to life.",1,1,24
"There is always something to do, someone to find, neat little things hidden all over and you never know what you will dig into when you go mining.",1,1,28
"This game is addictive fun, most of all I what really like the game play which hearkens back to the old 'theme' series of games way back when, I love the humour in the game too. ",1,1,36
Can not recommend two point campus highly enough!,1,1,8
""" it is amazing! No Man's Sky also makes me feel alone” which is a good thing. We may be social creatures, but we need time alone: time to think, time to reflect, and time to process our past, present, and future.",1,1,42
... I've only managed to explore 10 or so systems and haven't even gotten into farming and taming animals yet! ,1,1,20
The game does a pretty good job at guiding you through what to do without unnecessarily holding your hand.,1,1,19
" absolutely has proven itself above and beyond the call of duty for any video game as a leading title in the genre of survival, creative world-building, and space exploration.",1,1,29
";  That being said, it's a blast stacking up on doors and clearing rooms with any friends you decide to bring along.",1,1,22
This game will punish you for every decision made without mercy.,1,1,11
A very challenging tactical shooter,1,1,5
"with it is quintessential zany British humour, from the names of your teachers and students to the course names.",1,1,19
"another amazing game from two point, ",1,1,6
"I love customizing each individual room set,",1,1,7
" meeting the wacky moon beast challenges, and venturing further into the harder and harder hospital settups.",1,1,16
I LOVE this game. It demonstrates the difficulty of what it's like to be a police officer and enforces quick thinking along with situational awareness.,1,1,25
" I'm so glad I can play this as the real police officers do, arrest people, save hostages with friends.",1,1,19
"thanks to steam refund system, and my luck... almost perfect time management, I have my bucks back and look for something else.",1,0,22
for me it runs smooth as silk at 4k with highest settings. ,1,1,12
I did have some crashing issues last year but since reinstalling the game it is solid.,1,1,16
what's already here is fun but ruthless in challenge.,1,1,9
 plus with the steam integration you get to compare with your friends.,1,1,12
the game does a very good job of making each level interesting from the previous level,1,1,16
 (I shoot guns in real life) which makes the realism come true.,1,1,12
The gun recoil are super realistic  and the lower ready and feel/accuracy are hard to control,1,1,16
the tutorials and ongoing hints keep you on track and make it easy to play from the very start.,1,0,19
"2ph feels a bit prison architect-ish, and pa is a fav of mine.",1,0,13
" scrolling, moving, rotating were nice & easy with Keyboard & Mouse. ",1,0,11
"This game makes you feel like a kid again, where your curious mind takes you afar and wide, ",1,1,18
absorbed in the vastness of the unknowns in this world.,1,1,10
"A nice space exploration game nonetheless,",1,1,6
" the new update really fleshed out the world generation, terrain looks more natural, much more interesting as well.",1,1,18
 it’s just an open-world sandbox and you need to use your own imagination to keep it interesting.,1,1,17
"Base building and progression makes it quite fun for quite a while, but after you unlock most of the stuff",1,1,20
" the controller config is excellent, and the controls take about an hour to get used to coming from pc.",1,1,19
 I like the farming games and inventory slots come with progression.,1,1,11
"Died a couple times at the start but once I got the hang of it I became rather addicted,",1,1,19
"I now frequently spend my evenings streaming this game for my friends, who seem to get as much enjoyment out of watching as I do playing and talking about the content.",1,1,31
"and I place it very high among survival games, just below better games like Subnautica and Valheim, but infinitely better than garbage like Rust and Ark.",1,1,26
"I would still recommend this game to anyone, ",1,1,8
"If I had to criticise, I’d say more things to learn would be great (you can learn everything in the skill trees quite quickly),",1,1,24
" but as they keep adding improvements, it's possible that's already in the pipe.",1,1,13
"It popped up on my PC saying ""Cloud save out of sync, would you like to continue launch"" so I clicked ""Launch anyway"" and the game started right up and ran perfectly.",1,0,32
STEAMDECK - runs WAYY better and stable on my deck in all modes vs. 2022 gen gaming PC where I get a fair amount of random crashes.,1,1,27
 It's a tiny little puzzle minigame,1,1,6
" it's proud as itself and should continue in that path for success with providing a rare, intense experience found nowhere else nowadays.",1,1,22
"Ready or Not isn't a competitive PVP experience, it's not PUBG...",1,1,11
"The ""return and report"" methodology of the game helps you analyze your progress more thoroughly, and",1,1,16
 keeps you cognizant of the fact that your will be held responsible for you choices in game.,1,1,17
The colours in the game are pretty vibrant sometimes and the only lurch I only ever feel is when I'm flying into a planet and I see nothing but clouds and clouds.,1,1,32
"The developers brought the game back to life with massive, reputation-changing FREE updates,",1,1,13
 something you would never see from other developers in this day and age.,1,1,13
"the graphics are also quite unique,",1,1,6
" and again, many of the characters are fun to watch, especially if they have some amusing diseases and are moving in strange ways.",1,1,23
"The models of the weapons are very well done, ",1,1,9
"the options you have for your load out is great and you have the ability to customize your teammates load out as well, as well as their equipment and armor.",1,1,30
 This is literally Space Pirate Simulator everything else is just stuff you gotta do for kicks,1,1,16
"there is steam workshop support - and it is integrated brilliantly in this game - but it only applies to cosmetic touches like pictures, rugs, walls, and floors.",1,1,28
you can even join the beta to find out if the patches fix your problem.,1,1,15
they communicate what they are working on and even release new features after the community asked for them (example: copy+paste rooms). ,1,1,21
Sean Murray Really  with his hello games studio really scratched my itch ,1,1,12
scratched my itch of 80s retro sci fi like art style and space exploration .,1,1,15
A bit of a learning curve at first but once you get the hang of it it is great.,1,1,19
 Also I recommend watching a youtube video on optimizing it.,1,1,10
CO-OP with friends is amazing and for me full of wtf moments.,1,1,12
" If you dig the SWAT slow and methodical, domination threw teamwork and gadgetry, ",1,1,13
This is it and now for a reasonable price.,1,1,9
NMS has a deep story and might actually provide a valuable lesson in computer morality.,1,1,15
"Find crashed freighters, alien settlements, abandoned buildings and ancient artefacts. ",1,1,10
(just like real life university!).,1,1,5
" it's an absolutely gorgeous game with good gameplay, at least in my opinion.",1,1,13
"its a great game with a tongue in cheek narrative.  so if you are nervous about triggers or similar, this game handles it pretty well.",1,1,25
all of the maladies are for the most part fictional.,1,1,10
the fact I could use voice chat was cool.,1,1,9
but I loved playing with random people helping the new players learn the game and ,1,1,15
" the game is quite easy but hard to master because if you're not aware most of the time, you'll get killed easily so pay attention!",1,1,25
the game is so colorful and dynamic. and the different alien types are fun.,1,1,14
"The result is a game that has fun, satisfying gameplay and a story that fully and completely hooked me. It was mysterious, it was engaging, it was emotional, and it was heartfelt.",1,1,32
This game brings a mixture of high Tension serious game play with risks for every move you make to also being able to have fun with all riot shields and rams and setting off every trap.,1,1,36
this game is a fantastic time sink I really enjoy it I have not played the whole way through and I am definitely taking my time exploring my way through it as a bit of a completionist,1,1,37
"but it is fun, addicting even.",1,1,6
"Very immersive with the suspects grunting, crying, shouting from another room (because they fear me, ""the Sus[pect]slayer"", or because I once again shot blindly through the door).",1,1,27
and the puzzles were puzzling at least for me. if you wanna do relaxing puzzles,1,1,15
"what you expect from a point & click but the story was kinda cool,",1,1,14
"overall, a nice game to just do ",1,1,7
amazing and addicting concept with lot of potentialize ,1,1,8
Cross-play for other platforms would be cool too.,1,1,8
Great game ,1,1,2
I can spend a long time just taking photos on a planet.,1,1,12
i would say it is worth the price maybe even 10% off.,1,1,12
"In my 6 hours of play as of writing this I have found two: travel to the center of the universe, and essentially go on a pilgrimage to specific ancient space stations scattered around the universe. There’s a lot of flavor text written in first person; it really helps to immerse you when you're facing a gigantic red pulsing sphere telling you to discover the nature of existence. ",1,1,68
narrative (9/10) -two point does a lot of world-building and storytelling through the radio like I had mentioned earlier. you will find yourself looking around the map later in the game and recognizing places based on things you have heard on the radio or visitors you have had at your hospitals. I think this is a great narrative design for this kind of game and it honestly surprised me a little.,1,1,71
" it is a sim/tycoon style game, so we do not expect an epic on par with the odyssey here or anything. with that state of mind going in though,",1,1,29
really fun especially when you communicate with teammates. ,1,1,8
"The community is huge and the most helpful, kind and well behaved... of basically all communities I know so far. Never have I received hate mail, was bullied with in-game mechanics, met a griefer or a cheater etc etc. ",1,1,39
"Yes, there are people using glitches to duplicate items, trick the base building system and stuff like that. And the community knows that those people exist. Because those people are active members of the community and they are as welcome as everyone.",1,1,42
"the graphics are colorful, and really nice to look at.",1,1,10
"The mechanical sounds on operating your weapons and equipment’s, footsteps, whispering from suspects and radio comms with TOC provided many audio clues that serves in the gameplay element. The guns sounds very real and impactful and wont felt like a pea shooter, different weapons will have different effects when in the interior or external spaces. Bullets impacts and explosions sounds scary and have different layers of it depends on your location and distance to them.",1,1,75
"This ""upgrade"" was worth",1,1,4
worth every cent I paid for it.,1,1,7
This game is a must for anyone with a VR headset.,1,1,11
"This game is great! This is a real ""Spaceman Simulator""!",1,1,10
"This game makes me feel like both a super survivalist living on a sharp thin edge, or the dumbest most bumbling moron space tourist in the galaxy, only staying alive because the technology is so good. Driving = is a blast, do you have any idea how nice it is to have a starter vehicle that doesn’t flip over\ drift all over the place like everything is ice, or get stopped by tiny bits of terrain or ™¥™¥™¥™¥™¥™¥™¥ ",1,1,78
"Very good graphics, ",1,1,3
once you figure out how to reach level goals you can dive in deeper to challenge yourself- I miss the upgrades for all the rooms such as the surgery rooms,1,1,30
user friendly interface,1,1,3
has a bit of a learning curve+ fun easter eggs,1,1,10
" IN VIRTUAL REALITY is SO AMAZING it took my breath away I couldn't get off my Oculus Rift for weeks, ",1,1,20
that's how immersive the game was for me So if you EVER get this game I highly recommend getting into VR with it once you play it in VR you will never want to play the standard non VR: so trust me,1,1,42
"Best open world. I mean Galaxy, to explore with 18 quintillion planets in a massive open world game ",1,1,18
"Doing missions at the nexus with other players is awesome, when you can find people not in groups :p, and then going on a mission to a random planet full of players and player bases was awesome,",1,1,37
" it was a flourishing/paradise planet with ancient remains/natural burial sites, and I had the sense of the community kind of ""settling"" the planet themselves to make profit from the resources, just a really nice feeling compared to Version 1.",1,1,39
"gun-play is punchy, responsive, satisfying as hell.",1,1,7
realistic and satisfying as hell.,1,1,5
I love two point hospital so I was stoked for this game to release.,1,0,14
"I understand the hype now, very good game  watch a youtube review and buy it.",1,1,15
 but with an improved graphics engine.,1,1,6
"The generation is mid-good tier, not the best of the best but still amazing, the graphics are nice I don't like to say it but the graphics in such game would matter,",1,1,32
" accessibility options are very diverse, maybe a colourblind mode would be awesome, (excuse me if they already have that and I didn't know)",1,1,23
"and the customization options are spot-on, I loved the exotic ships, this game is about a 8.",1,1,17
" Also, the game is quite addictive ",1,1,6
"Then there is combat which consists of dogfights and on-foot combat. On-foot combat is nothing to write home about but the dogfights are where it gets fun. There's a lot of ship types too, some are meant for storage, some are meant for dogfights, and some are meant for exploration. The dogfights are honestly a lot of fun, especially when you've pissed off an entire species and every time you go in their galaxy they're gunning for you.",1,1,78
"Yes you can be a space pirate and pvp or pve with friends, however that is a very narrow aspect of the game, ",1,1,23
"it is more like zen gardening in space, with the occasionally laughing silly fit when you finally meet up with a friend, and despite the multiplayer features and it being cross play, you will spend most of the time tending to things by yourself unless you seek out one of the community planets or making friends at the nexus.",1,1,59
You can customize where you want your character to have armor,1,1,11
", the armor type, your main gun as well as your secondary (here you can choose from semi-automatic pistols, a revolver or a taser), grenades, your primary tool (e. g. breaching shotgun or shield), ammunition type, and more(+) ",1,1,38
I like the game and I like two point hospital as well but I had hoped the items had been updated more. ,1,1,22
cause it is just that good,1,1,6
"I would say it is not much more than a relaxing time waster. I am not too far into the game (i think) but it does not seem like there is much to do at all. The illness, perk names, and descriptions are cute/funny. ",1,1,44
The visual appearance is decent. ,1,1,5
Gameplay is boring so far but the small chuckles are keeping my curiosity wanting to see more content.,1,1,18
"It usually looks quite good, with countless fascinating planets, cool ships, and",1,0,12
 a ton of different things to see and explore. ,1,0,9
management gem! Build your own hospital and see how many patients you can kill daily!,1,1,15
Nice change of pace from other FPS shooters. ,1,1,8
Even learning new skills by just playing,1,1,7
Ready or Not is an extremely fun & challenging shooter that,1,1,11
" it favors people who try to coordinate with their team mates (or if you play solo, commanding the bots as well as possible) to take down the bad guys & save as many people as possible.",1,1,36
" keeps the fighting and movement more grounded & although you can try to play aggressively and rush,",1,1,17
"if you have a buddy, go for it!",1,1,8
"the developers put a lot of details in that game, from the entertaining radio moderator up to the many different people in your hospital which I also sometimes just like to watch and see what they do.",1,1,37
" in addition, the rooms can be designed with great attention to detail, and the game gives you the feeling that it was not in vain and ",1,1,26
rewards you with happy patients and staff.,1,1,7
"the downloadable content is why I wanted to play the game again,",1,1,12
"the game takes all kinds of different factors into account financially. you can take out loans, train, pay, and promote employees. set schedules. if you want a sneak peak at the things that go into running and owning a business. ",1,1,40
I highly recommend you check out this game especially ,1,1,9
"if you like easter eggs and puns, you will know what I mean after you start.",1,1,16
"The gameplay has depth, atmosphere",1,1,5
"even after 80+ hours in, planets can still get the rush of discovery going.",1,1,14
 but the game is still receiving regular updates with new content and ,1,1,12
There are some weird places and some amazingly beautiful places. You'll find yourself standing overlooking a valley that leads to an ocean with a ringed planet in the sky and the sun(s) setting at the horizon. There's a trade port over there where all sorts of ships are flying in to and out from. There's some weird building guarded by robots that may just have something interesting.,1,1,67
"Time is flying, the earth is rotating, and the no man's sky is still updating.",1,1,15
"Awesome game super realistic,",1,1,4
"Awesome! Really hard as a rock, with the last update, the bots are even more f*#@ing angry,",1,1,17
 anyway it seems a AAA game and not an indie one! ,1,1,11
"Enjoy this game with friends, and the most unlikely deaths will make you laugh out loud especially at the beginning of the game for the verses that the characters will emit upon receiving the bullets.",1,1,35
"Best Swat/Tatical shooter made yet,  other than its amazing!",1,1,9
"His world will take place in a vast world, stripped of its limitations, since all that will appear will be accessible to the smallest of nebulae in the remotest star, not to mention the countless planets or flake the Galaxy. ",1,0,40
These will provide you with their terrestrial or underwater world to satisfy your whims seasoned explorer.,1,0,16
i had this game on game pass on xbox and was obsessed with this game so I bought it on my laptop,1,1,22
if you enjoyed theme hospital from the late 90 is then this is definitely a game for you.,1,1,18
"If you have never played any of the Swat titles you will need to slow down and think very tactically, ",1,1,20
"you cannot afford to take any risks with this game, and every game is different so you never know where the enemies are, or the bombs. Absolute classic which I have no doubt I will still be playing when I'm a really old man.",1,1,44
it is fun and interactive with each restart or new map having different ways to go about them.,1,1,18
I guess sales will rocket when PvP mode is added.,1,1,10
"or you're looking for a game to fight space pirates, alien drones, tame animals, build incredible bases or just take some beautiful screenshots, I would recommend you try this game - ",1,1,31
"So overall, if you want a game to explore freely (there is also a creative mode for no stress) ",1,1,19
and AI camping in blind spots did make me jump off my seat.,1,1,13
"Some of the map detailing is outright creepy and actually did make my skin crawl a few times, ",1,1,18
"The ambience, mechanics, gameplay, atmosphere in maps are all spot on and really gives you that ""awful crime"" feeling that most other games tend to miss out on. ",1,1,28
The game entirely is a pretty fun experience ,1,0,8
the game is overall good and unique ,1,1,7
"The game looks great (especially in 4k), runs well",1,1,9
", and the gameplay is very enjoyable.",1,1,7
"This game's content is really nice,",1,0,6
Now I'm 50 hours in and completely enjoying the game.,1,1,10
"After a long silence, Hello Games has taken up the challenge of recreating a game that marvelled the world.",1,1,19
" People will tell you that the game is still broken and still is not good, but of what I have seen, this game has gone from completely useless to a brand new threat to other game making companies.",1,1,38
"at first, the amount of kudosh (the currency to unlock things), was hard to get but by the fourth campus, you should not have a problem meeting all these goals.",1,1,30
" there is plenty more to do that I did not touch on like hosting events, but I think some stuff should be left for you to discover.",1,1,27
"be quick, make good decisions, and play a micro-strategy tycoon like you were just star crafting or so.",1,1,18
Coming from a console player to my first PC build because of this game I'm super impressed and hooked it gives that nostalgic feeling I once had when first I played games back on PS1  I also set up a console friendly PS5 controller config IF anyone coming from console wanna give it a try.,1,1,55
"I highly recommend it,",1,1,4
"From mining valuable minerals to upgrading your ship and equipment, there's always something to do.",1,1,15
"glad they delayed the release, because this is awesome! ",1,1,9
really curious what they will add onto it!,1,1,8
I would definitely recommend this game.,1,1,6
 as I love this studio and there is a lot of lovely stuff in the game,1,0,16
"I saw this game is trailer two days before it was released on social media, and decided I wanted to play.",1,1,21
It has a better user interface then two point hospital. ,1,1,10
the scenarios are  fun and a bit challenging.,1,1,8
it's still a challenge to survive sometimes.,1,1,7
room creation and object placement is done on a grid layout ,1,1,11
which is pretty intuitive and easy to learn.,1,1,8
"the developers fixed the performance issue and all of the other bugs straight away, they also did the communities bidding by doing everything they asked for . Really and amazing game and developer team.",1,1,34
runs really well without performance problems and ,1,1,7
including adding a sandbox mode and copy and paste rooms,1,1,10
 lots of fun pop culture references.,1,1,6
the developer is twisted sense of humor adds to the games enjoyment.,1,1,12
"The game draws on many of the classic sim game elements, such as resource management, micromanagement and problem solving.",1,1,19
"the game features a range of fun and challenging objectives, from curing illnesses to managing staff, and gives players the freedom to build their own custom hospitals. ",1,1,27
"the radio in-game is awesome, but I would tend to turn off music and put on the original th soundtrack.",1,1,20
"The sights this game offers is unlike any other, as I started going into photo more way more often. ",1,1,19
This game is a very worthwhile purchase,1,1,7
 for those looking for a realistic tactical response simulation.,1,1,9
this game runs great on a laptop/pc,1,1,7
 and graphics can be adjusted to allow you to enjoy the best experience.,1,1,13
"very good optimized, still got 60 fps on a old geforce of 2gb of vram on high setting worth the purchase!",1,1,21
"Where the majority of shooters on the market encourage concentration and practice in acquiring the highest number of casualties possible, ",1,1,20
 Ready or Not provides an opportunity to practice precise discernment and defusing of a situation with as little room for error or injury as possible.,1,1,25
"While this game is very visually impressive, ",1,0,7
"And, if you have a VR headset you can play in VR that is very immersive (and quite motion sickening at times).",1,1,22
"fun, cartoony graphics ",1,1,3
and some clever lampoons of the medical care industry make nice icing ,1,1,12
on this management cake.,1,1,4
I have come to expect little of sims games due to the standard EA set with the sims 4 upon its half-baked release ,1,1,23
"I have come to expect little of sims games due to the standard EA set with the sims 4 upon its half-baked release but this game proves that it’s possible to create a well-designed, affordable sim game that is complete on launch and fun with and without played content.",1,1,49
3 hours later and I cannot stop ... not even sure what I am curing but I am 3 starring the sh*t out of all my hospitals and cannot wait to dive back in.,1,1,34
 but still a nice time-passing colony-building style sim to run in the background.,1,1,13
while the graphics and animations are still comical,1,1,8
" it is ... a more scaled-back, mindless experience,",1,1,8
It would benefit greatly from steam workshop compatibility for some variety with regards to wall art and rugs.,1,1,18
" telling their unique stories, definitely worth having a look around when you get the chance.",1,1,15
"maps are very detailed,",1,1,4
"nowadays its very rare a game catches my attention as much as two point campus has, , and background music/dj that gives some comedy as you play.",1,1,27
"it has an original appeal especially with the easter eggs in game, very lively characters that add life to the game",1,1,21
"Other than that, Love this game, can play for hours on end. . Really looking forward to the future of this game.",1,1,22
"Putting this game on geforce now, was the smartest decision a game designer could make. ",1,1,15
"RP with learning languages and skills, quest, build bases work together or",1,1,12
" against other players, this has the works!",1,1,7
"as the Ai aren't totally braindead, and can respond to threats reasonably well.",1,1,13
"Single player mode isn't bad, ",1,1,5
with air/space combat and a storyline that slowly unfolds itself ,1,1,10
and there are just about enough mechanics to explore the first 30 hours or so.,1,1,15
the humor and visual style are fun ,1,1,7
"The last time I reviewed this game was when I got it, ",1,1,12
I still think this is a fun game for people that are in to Law Enforcement Games and also have a group of friends you would want to play it with.,1,1,31
"It has been sometime now and  there has been a lot of updates,",1,1,13
The realism in terms of sence is just top notch.,1,1,10
"weapon handling, hit reaction and the ""punchy feel"" of the shootouts is just top notch.",1,1,15
"Don't get me wrong, I don't mind combat, in fact I really enjoyed it when it was simple and relatively infrequent.",1,1,21
this version does not crash as much,1,1,7
d it is a fun hospital management game with ,1,1,9
"lots of little easter eggs and references to add to the enjoyment. fans of always sunny in Philadelphia will enjoy the janitor is roles being referred to as ""Charlie work"" for example",1,1,32
"At the moment gun customization is good, but the rig customization is phenomenal and not as complex as Ground Branch.",1,1,20
"I played more than 20hrs, but still fun at 43 hrs in repeating the gameplay. ",1,1,15
" If you're still not convinced, keep an eye on this game anyway, it may surprise you.",1,1,16
I put this game on my Wishlist over a year ago ,1,1,11
"I wish it had an easy way to pull up a mission menu to see the objectives again (probably does, but I just started playing today, and still finding new controls that I thought weren't available on the controller lol).",1,1,40
"its easy to get absorbed in creating the perfect hospital, there is so much to take into consideration from staff, training, what facilities to build and upgrade and limited time challenges to bring prestige and currency awards to your hospital network.",1,1,41
and I pre-ordered as soon as I could.,1,1,8
"  I saw the teaser trailer back in 2016, ",1,1,8
I've been a supporter for this game ever since,1,1,9
"like always, I was tempted to play it due to the influence of gaming youtubers, ",1,1,15
overall this game is actually dope.,1,1,6
Okay devs I love the game and I wanna see something ,1,1,11
The visuals (in my opinion) are upper-level indie style.but definitely still nice to look at.,1,1,15
and you can simultaneously zoom and or rotate the camera freely.,1,1,11
the world is intricately detailed and rendered in 3d ,1,1,9
"There is a story to follow about an alien civ which is interesting and then there is the mysterious ""center of the universe"".",1,1,23
This game is a great tactical shooter. ,1,1,7
It involves great teamwork and coordination to end up with outstanding scores.,1,1,12
I bought this game to get a real feel for the fast-paced and hectic hospital environment.,1,1,16
But there can more than 5 players...  your voice is specialized so people hear you only up close. Other channels are more convenient as the hear you wherever you are.,1,1,30
"You can choose different voice comm channels, one is ""local"" and",1,1,11
"Creative Mode, that is accessible immediately after installation is ""god-mode"" & ",1,1,11
"Cheat built in. Allows for free roaming and building without worrying about dying, retardedly boring resource farming or even game currency cost for building.",1,1,24
"each hospital location has unique goals, from teaching and training specific educational goals for staff members, to combating a cascade of pandemics and natural disasters, and encouraging creative strategies to reach each goal.",1,1,33
"go check out GhostRobo is youtube channel, he has some good in depth gameplay videos showcasing what this game is really like.",1,1,22
reasonable feeling of progression,1,1,4
"good management choices, , ",1,1,4
enough challenge to be interesting but not so much to be frustrating.,1,1,12
I also hope they would add more Achievements to the game would be fun to work towards,1,1,17
 and give me more of a reason to play more.,1,1,10
 I really enjoyed exploration (15 or so planets) before all planets were just reskinned versions of old ones.,1,1,18
I really enjoyed the 5+ actual hours,1,1,7
I remember playing theme hospital as a kid. this is the spiritual successor. ,1,1,13
"same sense of humor, similar art style, and the game play feels familiar. ",1,1,13
"that said it allows for better management, a story line, and overall, better tuned.",1,1,14
"If spending hours scouring an obscure planet to find one more bizarre lifeform, one more hidden station, one more blueprint tucked away in some terminal can suck you in, ",1,1,29
then you can easily forgive the basic and repetitive gameplay.,1,1,10
"if you install a mod, you can adjust the traits of your staff. There is a trait that reduces patient health by 5% upon interaction. The mod lets you add multiple of the same trait. I made a hospital where the reception stabs people.",1,1,44
if you like management games like theme park and rollercoaster tycoon this is up your street get it 9/10 amazing fun game and,1,1,23
"it is a fun to game to play while listening to podcasts, but the funny voice lies make it worth playing unmuted. Fun and relaxing",1,1,25
It’s a good time killer if you are hooked easily but be aware ,1,1,13
" Interface 5/5no complaints, menu works great, job selection is easy and navigation to different areas in the game are simple.",1,1,20
mapping 3/5 there are different hospitals you can participate in that have different layouts/building styles.,1,1,15
"overall, the gameplay is solid a few small bugs that make, mechanics are amazing",1,1,14
 I left COD to play this and will start streaming here shortly,1,1,12
" charming, with great music, is a joy to play.",1,1,9
"the game is very well crafted, truly a spiritual successor to theme hospital,",1,1,13
"This game is very fun, I recommend a good headset so you can hear all the drug addicts walking around the house you have to clear and maybe a diaper for when they bust through that door as you’re trying to look under with the mirror gun.",1,1,47
especially with friends to explore the galaxy and complete missions with.,1,1,11
"This game really is amazing, and is so much fun, ",1,1,10
"Whether you choose to follow the main storyline, become a galactic trader, , or simply wander the stars in search of the perfect planet to call home, it's a game that invites players to create their own narrative.",1,1,38
10/10 Take the haunting imagery and symbolism of Stanley Kubrick is 2001: ,1,1,12
a Space Odyssey and combine the gameplay of Minecraft and Starfox.,1,1,11
" its really hard at first but once you get past the learning curve, you're pretty much set.",1,1,17
"Absolutely Slaps, this game is just top tier",1,1,8
"AI are insanely difficult, but mission can be cleared if you think carefully. ",1,1,13
This game punishes heavily if you make a wrong decision.,1,1,10
"Although the game's graphical style is not truly realistic and a bit more on the fairy tale side of things,",1,1,20
 the game world is still marvellous to look at and invites for many photo/screenshot safaris to happen.,1,1,17
this is worth each and every money I spent.,1,1,9
"buy it! It is sure to give you a great many fun filled hours. The first 6 hospitals won not give you much trouble, but after you will find yourself restarting the hospital level a few times until you have learned the ropes.",1,1,43
 Communication and teamwork is essential to complete the challenges that await.,1,1,11
"Fantastic to play with friends, alone or even with others.",1,1,10
"i can honestly say I never usually laugh at videogame humour, but this one really got me when I clicked on a staff profile and the doctor was facing the wrong way in the photo such that it was the back of his head.",1,1,44
" There is no hero trying to save the damn world, no action scenes with stupid QTEs, no .",1,1,18
"I know that this is a game focused on procedurally generated worlds, and I expected exactly that, and I got exactly what I expected.",1,1,24
adding new and varied hyper-micromanagement challenges that keep me engaged.,1,1,10
"it maintains the same humor, puns, and ridiculousness while ",1,1,9
" but I've been following RON since I heard of it's release, and I am not disappointed in anyway shape, or form.",1,1,21
"Off sale it's pretty pricey, but it's one of the rare little treasures that's genuinely worth every penny if you can't wait for a sale.",1,1,25
"Ready or Not is the ultimate tool for you to explore your way of complete violation of the Geneva Conventions, whether that be through gassing enemies to shooting hostages, the choice is yours in this epic war crime simulator!",1,1,39
"Sharing stories, trading goods,",1,1,4
 or engaging in friendly competition ,1,1,5
make for unforgettable experiences within the vastness of the universe.,1,1,10
 early on I was sceptical but now I'd fully agree EVEN AFTER all the additions since launch.,1,0,17
"The AI is often fairly unpredictable,; some tweaks still need to be made, as sometimes they can still John Wick your ass fairly easily, ",1,1,24
"the atmosphere was very well done,",1,0,6
"The attention to detail from prop placement to lighting makes the game absolutely beautiful! Your guns create smoke when fired, the light bounces off of mirrors and windows, your scopes reflect your surroundings and more!",1,1,35
"The guns are varied and have some cool customization, ",1,0,9
"Very very fun game,",1,1,4
it provides a very chill and easy experience so you can get that space exploration without a powerful computer or hours of game play practice.,1,1,25
you can pick this game up and enjoy immediately but the more you play the more your realise there are deep mechanics to explore and master.,1,1,26
amazing new vibe love it epic and hard and rewarding,1,1,10
as a big fan of theme hospital this was an instant purchase for me.,1,1,14
to me it feels like a modern re-release of the original with a nice coat of paint ,1,1,17
without some of the pain points of the original release.,1,1,10
"great game: cool humor, satisfying gameplay mechanics, reasonable and ""configurable"" pacing - you can move on if you want, you can stay longer to pick up basics and mechanics, so you won not be overwhelmed.",1,1,35
"I learned a lot of skills on to how to properly diagnose and cure a plethora of diseases, and most importantly on how to keep my co-workers happy.",1,1,28
"I like in games to make decisions, plan things, have some strategy, accomplish things and learn how to play better.",1,0,20
"Obviously, it is a variation on two point hospital which was a variation on good old theme hospital which is, in my opinion, still the best of the bunch.",1,0,29
I played The Last Campfire first - and after that super positive experience I was keen to see what No Man's Sky was about.,1,1,24
 I am in love - every environment is absolutely a feast for my eyes!,1,1,14
 but this game is a breath of fresh air among modern shooters. ,1,1,12
"Slow, methodical and oppressive, with high lethality and many dangers behind every corner. ",1,1,13
then two point hospital is definitely worth checking out.,1,1,9
"if you are looking for a game that will make you laugh and keep you entertained for hours, ",1,1,18
"If you enjoy sandbox, exploration and, like me, enjoy whacky, unconventional plots and game design, ",1,1,15
this game should be the next on your Wishlist.,1,1,9
"If you like progression, you may be in luck, as the game offers many ways to upgrade your ship, suit, and multitool so you can do nothing faster.",1,0,28
"if you want the business management side there is plenty here you can optionally delve into (pricing, loans and so on), but the key is that it is optional.",1,1,29
it is much better in terms of user friendliness and customization options.,1,1,12
" the styles and the colors pop with the environment better. every few minutes I am in aww with your animations, music, and objects.",1,1,23
" build your own stuff in sandbox, create templates, play the challenges, collaborative play, the list goes on and on.",1,1,19
it is strategic and never boring.,1,1,6
"Its breathtaking visuals, ",1,1,3
"sense of exploration, and continuous updates make it an ever-evolving journey that ",1,1,12
rewards curiosity and imagination.,1,1,4
"No Mans Sky gives you the freedom to do whatever you want, while also guiding you along a path that shows you all the game can offer, which is quite a lot.",1,1,32
"the game is fine,",1,0,4
the options to play online challenges with friends who also have the game is fun for those who need some more social interaction in the game.,1,1,26
"the sound for this game is really good, guns feel nice and punchy also being able to hear the people through the walls preparing for you is a nice touch.",1,1,30
This game is way to good to pass up especially if you have v desktop and a VR headset takes a while to figure out but is good and ,1,1,29
I really like that it takes so long to get bored so still going,1,1,14
"Well, since rainbow6 siege has became ""overwatch 1.5"" or as I preferred as ""super heroes Olympic game"", who only like SWAT-type of game or a proper counter terrorist simulator game, ""Ready or Not"" is for you.",1,1,36
 sega proves they still got it after all this time10/10,1,1,10
addictive gameplay hilarious diseases sandbox mode quick to pick up and overwhelmingly hard to put down until you finish everything,1,1,20
"also there is a fun Facebook group to join as well that is fan ran and creates fun challenges and an open, friendly environment to discuss strategies, stories and get help with anything!",1,1,33
"Everyone has seen the YouTube video ""The Engoldening of No Man's Sky"" if not you are doing yourself a disservice and need to get some good food and watch the whole thing with apt attention.",1,1,35
 but it's still in its development stages so that's to be expected.,1,1,12
"Nothing about these negative points diminish the overall pleasure of the game - it is cute, fun, quirky, mindlessly relaxing.",1,1,20
" and with some variable spawns to change up each match, so it doesn't feel to repetitive.",1,1,16
I've ran through every map currently out and every mode currently out and they are quite detailed,1,1,17
But now we have camera controls and more precise positioning controls etc. Get it.,1,1,14
On the technical side I have not encountered any issues even with a pretty big level 18 hospital ,1,1,18
"Ready or not is an excellent first person shooter, and ",1,1,10
it is an excellent representation of the teamwork and communication needed to tackle CQB environments.,1,1,15
Especially since the devs are constantly patching/updating and making it the police game they and we want it to be.,1,1,20
"So far, I really like it definitely worth the â‚¬30, - or whatever it's at. ",1,1,15
"the building your own stuff was not new to me, but the way two point campus is set up brings a new life to the whole 'build your own', its a whole lot of fun!",1,1,35
"The in-game currency is so easy to get,",1,1,8
" and the community is very nice and when you visit the Nexus, people often give you expensive stuff just because why not.",1,1,22
 This is still early access you have to remember that which means a lot still has to be made but it got so much potential and its fun.,1,1,28
"This game just has everything,",1,1,5
very fun and relaxing game. it is also forgiving with the layout choices you make. You can still reach 3 stars even if you screw up some rooms in your hospital.,1,1,31
"A single screen where I can click different tabs to select my equipment, choose the mission, look at mission debrief, and ready up would be nice (kind of like SWAT 4).",1,1,31
"All-in-all, a great game for fans of the SWAT series, ",1,1,10
"As mentioned, running in the background and playing casually while waiting in a dungeon queue in an massively multiplayer online game or catching up on laundry worked for me.",1,1,29
"as some other reviewers stated during that free weekend, two point hospital is a ""hospital tycoon like game"" that ",1,0,19
"Customization of your kit and individual items is really good, letting you create loadouts for different tools and armor setups in addition to guns and ammunition types.",1,1,27
 there are tonnes of different story line,1,1,7
choices for endless replay value.,1,1,5
exploration and sandbox is the name of the game and if you get sick of that (i doubt you will)s and ,1,1,21
 I just bought it and played for a few hours not realising how fast the time passed by.,1,1,18
"Honestly, I could say this is one of the best games I've played in the last few years,",1,1,18
I'm partial to things such asthis game delivers all that pretty darn well.,1,1,13
" sci-fi space exploration, base-building, aerial dogfighting and multi-species/AI existential philosophy... ",1,1,10
"it has put its own spin on things while maintaining the humour and chaos, but with tighter controls and management and some deeper immersion. ",1,1,24
Definitely a thumbs up from me.,1,1,6
love the ability to go back to previous hospitals when you level up and even farm earlier hospitals for research and unlocks. ,1,1,22
a very clever and very thought out game.,1,1,8
"Newest update has addressed my only real gripe with the game, and",1,1,12
 as I've never seen a 'realistic' shooter in a SWAT setting (Siege was the closest I got).,1,1,17
"Normally a game that has this style isn't my type of game, but it looked intriguing",1,1,16
Once you learn how to keep your ship flying ,1,1,9
"you can just hop around exploring each new system or you can focus on trading,",1,1,15
", or even acquiring your own freighter fleet.",1,1,8
 A full VR game with the same physics and cross play with desktop players would just be amazing.,1,1,18
Recommendations- -Eventually seeing this game worked into VR would be awesome.,1,1,11
"so, I have seen this game floating about on the YouTube and twitch, so I thought id have a gander at it being as it was on sale. I can now see why folk like it so much!",1,1,38
"The addition of multiplayer functionality allows for cooperative or competitive gameplay, enabling players to explore and interact with others in the vastness of space.",1,1,24
This cartoonish medical management sim is hilarious and extremely addictive! ,1,1,10
everything from the wacky patients to the self-absorbed staff always leave me wanting more.,1,1,14
"While Ready or Not and SWAT 4 occupy different spaces for me, those spaces are closely bound, and ",1,1,18
I would recommend anyone who enjoys this game to try SWAT 4 with the SEF overhaul.,1,1,16
With the different weapons and the fact that there is VOIP and ,1,1,12
the ability to play online with people and still be able to communicate is a huge upside in my opinion.,1,1,20
"You can get a good impression of the core gameplay by seeing the loadouts, mission levels and different modes and how the maps change slightly based on the mode and objective.",1,1,31
10/10 I really recommend this game so yea give it a shot!,1,0,12
"fresh and good idea.it is similar to 2ph, but I find that they made good use of the engine and mechanics to make a more or less realistic and funny simulation of a campus.",1,1,34
"I find it to be less addictive than 2ph as it is more around ""decorating rooms and floors"", but they put a lot of work and creative effort for the courses, animations and graphics. All in all: I like the game and I can recommend :)",1,1,46
" The game still needs some polishing, but it has been recently released and they will fox the remaining bugs, balance the game out, add new mechanics and make it even better. ",1,1,31
Game is pretty cool and all,1,0,6
I believe this will be a super solid game in its official release form.,1,1,14
"i enjoyed it, the puzzles are interesting ",1,1,7
but not maddingly difficult.,1,1,4
", there isn't much levels to play like in swat 4 at the moment, but the levels are fun because of its difficulty, and I think there is enough levels for an early access game.",1,1,35
"Not only that, but two point campus has taken what was in hospital and taken the next step. there is more customisation options, more creativity, more interesting behaviours from your students.",1,1,31
"Not knowing what I was doing I left the planet and entered space in my little ship. I was on a planet orbiting a massive black hole. Fear struck down me but I knew I had to set my sights to the planet next to me. I land on this bizarre planet, nothing but ocean. Yet there was a small island, so I landed my ship. I got out and observed my newfound planet. ",1,1,74
That was all I needed to see to know that I'm going to absolutely love this game.,1,1,17
"My opinion aside, what is Ready or Not? Ready or Not at this point in time IS the closest thing you can get to the real deal regarding CQB simulation on video games in my humble opinion, ",1,1,37
"now this opinion of mine comes with some caveats: I do NOT have formal training or certified experience from any public or private security company, be that enforcing as a police officer, nor have I been in military service, I am but the one guy that loves tactical simulators, I have played the vast majority of them, and I have some theorical knowledge of CQB that I've learned from my own research on the internet for fun / roleplay purposes in these kind of games, and I must admit, that from all the games I have played, applying those basic concepts from the CQB professionals I've heard over the course of time really hits home with this one.",1,1,118
and good for screenshot lol,1,1,5
 I like it. ,1,1,3
the Bing Chilling John Xina meme/easter egg in the game files is best,1,1,13
"but I’ve pay a complete game, not just 4 maps.",1,0,10
"The game is really good, ",1,0,5
There are also multiplayer missions that can be initiated from The Anomaly where other players in the hub can join you and embark on a journey to a distant star system to complete a simple task.,1,1,36
 You can get such crazy things like jetpack that emits rainbows or some badass bounty hunter helmet for your character.,1,1,20
 I cannot wait to share it with my friends.,1,1,9
This game is super enjoyable,1,1,5
"This is, hands down, the best game in the open-world space MMO genre.",1,1,13
"What I actually do want to talk about is the fact that, whatever the state of the game might have been or might become, I really enjoyed this game. I enjoyed the almost surreal atmosphere (literally and figuratively) of a world so seemingly alive and full of things to do that you could study every single life form and landmass across the surface of the immense planets if you so choose. I'm not one for mindless exploration but there's so much to find and so much that caught my eye that I was baffled. Crashed ships, maps, secrets, mysteries and societies to bargain with and even run for yourself.",1,1,109
"The Atlas is a mystery. I have barely deciphered the first alien race is language I have encountered, but slowly learning to communicate. I am really curious about these infected stations I keep encountering...There is some kind of backstory to the sentinels being some kind of self-replicating machines that took over the universe, and I am excited to find out more about it.",1,1,63
an extremely tactical first person shooter ,1,1,6
with gruelling realism and detail.,1,1,5
"Although it has plenty of ironic comments on modern health factories, it feels also impressively correct in its depiction of how these buildings are conceptualized and work in reality. while playing, I heard (in my mind) colleagues saying things this like ""my new office is now in front of a toilet, urgh, and then there is this vending machine where people gather and chat the entire day.",1,1,67
using night vision is cool.,1,1,5
"Gun play is fantastic, movement and ",1,1,6
controls are easy to learn and very effective.,1,1,8
Have a few hundred hours invested on console,1,1,8
I like everything... ,1,1,3
"in terms of difficulty, there are certainly some scenarios that might stump you. in these cases, you will soon discover a strategy that works and restarting the level with a fresh new goal will often lead you to success.",1,1,39
If you are new to the series then you will discover a business management simulation with a slow learning curve that eases you into the genre with an extensive campaign mode.,1,1,31
 then this is a game for you.,1,1,7
"If you ever played the game SWAT 4 and liked it,",1,1,11
"It's fun to play with your friends I have another 3 friends that I played with, one of them didn't like the game because he likes being a douche and killing other players in other competitive games, there is friendly fire, but ",1,1,42
"Somehow, through the absolute toxicity of the terrible launch, we, the community, have successfully filtered out most of the trolls and abusers that used to frequent the forums and subreddits, leaving us with a wholesome, and surprisingly large community of dedicated players from around the world, even bridging game console gaps and encouraging production of the game on as many platforms as possible.",1,1,63
The game doesn't hold your hand but the interface and controls are intuitive.,1,1,13
"The game is a lot of fun and it makes the most of the classic ""management"" type of gameplay.",1,1,19
"The learning curve is gradual, allows you to really get to grips with the mechanics of the game before adding additional obstacles and tasks.  but I really enjoy how the game does not take itself seriously. ",1,1,36
this game makes me laugh out loud while playing and always makes me feel happy.,1,1,15
"Unlocked loads of exotic items through quicksilver missions. I've made an activated indium mine and a stasis device farm., even reaching the centre of the galaxy in permadeath mode...",1,1,29
 I've completed every achievement,1,1,4
" I've done all that and I still have things I want to do. Quite simply, this game is amazing, and I will gladly spend many more hours exploring its infinite possibilities.",1,1,31
This is the most underrated title out there imo.,1,1,9
Update after another 60+ hours: ,1,1,5
"You can own up to 6 fantastic star ships, which you can use for transportation and other purposes.",1,1,18
" There are several classes of ship, including the Fighter, which almost everyone is most fond of. The all-purpose Shuttle which has good starting cargo stats, the dependable and durable Haulers, whose increased shielding keeps them alive in dogfights, and the Explorer, which enables you to travel the galaxy in the blink of an eye.",1,1,54
"""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. "" The 3-rd law by Arthur C. Clarke. I started a review with Clarke's quotation, because the world of ""No Man's Sky"" is really magical despite its obvious sci-fi basis. ",1,1,38
"It is magical by its structure and physics, by nature of items and species, even by the plot with saving the princess.",1,1,22
A new and special game with prospects and lately with more and more upgrades and hotfixes.,1,1,16
"But I always loved theme hospital, and have not played it in a very, very long time.",1,1,17
" What type of body armor are you going to wear? Choose from none, to light and heavy armor. Do you want kevlar, steel, or ceramic plates? Do you want a stab vest? Do you want to armor your front, back, sides or any combination thereof? In this game you can.",1,1,50
Equipment wise the game is really good. You have lots of different weapons and ammunition types to use.,1,1,18
"Fun experience overall, greatly enhanced by playing with friends and the shared incompetence.",1,1,13
"Graphics - 8/10 - looks great, not photorealistic but it doesn't need to be.",1,1,14
I completed all the super hard achievements in ONE DAY!?!?! OMG my life is completed.,1,1,15
I played the crap outta every bullfrog game; theme hospital was the one I preferred.,1,0,15
"If you want a first person version of Stellaris with a dash of Minecraft, this is it.",1,1,17
Overall if you are a VR player that stand on the balcony looking out over the horizon in true a VR experience.,1,1,22
feels neglected by Elite Dangerous and their new way of projecting,1,1,11
 a virtual 2D screen in front of your face and calling it VR for all on foot gameplay you will probably feel more at home in this game. ,1,1,28
I absolutely cannot wait for the Steam Workshop and proper modding to come so maps and cool overhaul mods are more accessible and one click away rather than manually placing them on the pack folder.,1,1,35
Ready or Not has the potential to be very great and so far shows that it can grow to a better game ,1,1,22
"Really immersive, dark, and has zero filter with what nasty happens in the real world.",1,1,15
 if the game updates and proves itself.,1,0,7
"SWAT 4 for me was easily the pinnacle in tactical FPS games and RON has taken that spot now,  building off of the concept that existed and refining it for a modern gaming generation.",1,1,34
The AI are tough and adaptive. ,1,1,6
" The game forces you to think about how you want to approach stressful, dangerous situations with only your limited resources at hand.",1,1,22
"The Environmental story telling in the game is fantastic in my mind and does a lot to fill out the world around you,",1,1,23
 this last supporter update added a lot more voice line variety to suspects in different locales that pertain to the situations at hand and,1,1,24
 sometimes even make you feel just a little bit for the people you're arresting.,1,1,14
"There are a lot of hints in the game towards a deeper story and lot is of directions they can go. The developers did say there are easter eggs in the galaxy and that may be something that will be discovered later or added in once they figure out where to put them, so people actually run into them. Either way it will be interesting.",1,1,65
"There are half a dozen levels or so to play with different scenarios available to select on each which vary in difficulty (bomb threat, active shooter, hostage rescue to name but a few) ",1,1,33
There are plenty of weapons/equipment to choose from as well which can be modified to suit your playstyle. ,1,1,18
"There's still lots for me to discover for now, ",1,1,9
"This game does it's best to emulate real life with a number of mechanics, including slower tactical pace, civilian commentary, the opportunity to make an arrest instead of killing someone, the possibility of a suspect pulling out a weapon or running at you before an arrest can be made, and",1,1,50
 a number of other details that will surely improve over the life of this game.,1,1,15
 it makes you feel emotions.,1,1,5
This game is like rust in space but less chaotic and,1,1,11
"But the level of responsiveness of the developers that I’ve observed It does not shy away from telling the truth, it does not even attempt to filter the truth in any way.",1,1,32
so far has given me enough confidence to recommend the title to anyone who appreciates this level of honesty and has the required amount of seriousness. ,1,1,26
"fun and a very straight-forward, breezy sim game. ",1,1,8
"once you learn how to play it, it is very easy to dominate. I never feared for having money, even at the start of a map, or with really any decision I made. unfortunately, this is also its downfall. ",1,1,39
i do miss the old diagnosis but being able to change camera angles and the fun treatment rooms.,1,1,18
"I grew up on Rainbow six, Day of defeat and ghost recon and this game kinda fills that void for me.",1,1,21
"i have completed all levels and unlocked all content, and ",1,1,10
really enjoyed all my time spent on it.,1,1,8
I started playing again last week and am having a lot of fun with it.,1,1,15
I can only say I've played 99 Hours all of which is single player and I love it still to experience the online side of the game.,1,1,27
"In all seriousness this game is brilliant, one of those games where you'll find yourself playing for hours, then rage quit, only to return the day after to try again win then rage quit again ",1,1,35
Pretty much every option I would desire is in there. You can change difficulty of enemies. You can change damage done to you and your ship. Several other options as well.,1,1,31
Just buy it. Incredible... the amount of things you can now do.,1,1,12
That was the other fact of the game that managed to capture my curiosity and imagination: ,1,1,16
"the sense that the planet was fully alive and teeming with myriad forms of life, both animal and plant, in sometimes bizarre, sometimes amusing displays of diversity thanks to the idiosyncrasies of procedurally generated algorithms.",1,1,35
environmental destruction is top notch.,1,1,5
" gunplay is on the level of say tarkov, ",1,1,8
"The graphics are A1,",1,1,4
There is a steep learning curve to become familiar with the games technology but that is part of the fun.,1,1,20
 I would recommend this game for everyone.,1,1,7
"this game brings back wonderful memories of theme hospital as it was a fun game to play back in the day, now I am enjoying this one as it has new and weird illness and devices for curing them as well locations that needs certain equipment to counter heat or cold temperatures for example.",1,1,54
"there are not a bunch of decisions you have to make or details you need to keep track of compared to some other sims, but you still get the feeling you are in control of the gameplay.",1,1,37
"this is a great sim builder game for those who like low pressure, less customization, less of a ""learning curve"" type games. ",1,1,22
VR works great and,1,1,4
 the variety of updates that come out every month or two adds more to the game.,1,1,16
"You can build elaborate bases pretty much anywhere you choose, and in space you can build a base on a freighter ",1,1,21
which is a crucial component when it comes to managing your extensive and diverse inventory. You will build storage units on your freighter so that you can categorize and store the different types of items you procure.,1,1,37
"at the beginning, they will be new doctor is offices, new diagnostic rooms, so that in the later stages of the game you will be able to unlock the possibility of training doctors, conducting research, or even using extensive marketing or counteracting epidemics inside the hospital.",1,1,46
Coop is an absolute fantastic experience with friends that share the same passion for tactics and teamplay.,1,1,17
games based around random number generator are very difficult to make and luck be landlord does this extremely well,1,1,19
"I played it on xbox on game pass, enjoyed it so much ",1,1,12
I bought the whole pack here on steam just to support two point studio.,1,1,14
I can literally play this for hours on end without stopping. Try it!,1,1,13
it is a great way to have a little fun and explore the possibility of what it is like managing a hospital - and a pile of laughs while you are at it. ,1,1,33
"I was an original fan of ""theme hospital"" which this game is derived from.",1,1,14
I would like to see better support for mods and a workshop where mods can be uploaded and shared FREE of charge.,1,1,22
"If you can handle stressful situations, and the inevitable, innocent lives on your conscience, this game is for you!",1,1,19
"it is full of amusing puns, ",1,1,6
 you can customise so much with the steam workshop.,1,1,9
"funny radio station, funky music and",1,1,6
I've had this game for a while now and they've added/changed so many things to make the game better with every update. ,1,1,22
"On the most recent patch, they implemented being able to save loadouts for yourself and your AI teammates which takes a lot of time out of picking a gun, attachments, grenades etc.",1,1,32
love the game... I like to take things easy and build up and tpc lets you do that. no steep learning curve etc.,1,1,23
the game is super fun.,1,1,5
you'll need quick reactions to take them down,1,1,8
"The creation aspect of the game is what intrigues me the most and if it was really fleshed out into more of a sandbox style would be amazing, there could be new ores and plants giving you a reason to go out and get more things which ",1,1,47
could then unlock more things to build with to keep things diverse.,1,1,12
the sound effects of the game are also very creative advantages help make the world feel very much alive ,1,1,19
I have been playing this on an older laptop and have had no issues with performance running it on high settings. ,1,1,21
graphics: 9 - the graphics themselves look fantastic and suit the game perfectly!,1,1,13
This game also makes an effort to remind you you are a police officer and not a soldier.,1,1,18
"You can go either online with a group of up to 5 or play single player with 4 other AI teammates, ",1,1,21
which is mainly what I've done. The actual friendly AI is pretty decent - been some minor bugs with their pathing but 90% of the time they have behaved as expected and carried out orders properly.,1,1,36
You move through challenging tactical environments while having to rapidly determine if an individual is a threat or a civilian - and then respond accordingly all within the bounds of law enforcement rules of engagement. ,1,1,35
"The graphics, audio, recoil, and map design create a uniquely realistic experience.",1,1,12
" It was me or them - a split second decision. I am not happy about the destruction I have caused, but I am happy that I have defended myself in a way that neutralised the palpable threat.",1,1,37
"Your honour, it was a self-defence situation. If I did not shoot that unarmed civilian, I would have been killed.",1,1,20
" and I sincerely praise Hello games for all the work they have done and continue doing after 2 years, when they could have simply skipped the flop of the initial release and moved to another brand new title.",1,1,38
In the end in my opinion NMS is a really good game,1,1,12
"as an older gamer, who remembers with great affection the original theme hospital, I have to say I am blown away by this.",1,1,23
" Of course, it is a remake of an old classic, but it has upgrades, new additions and a fun narrative that makes it feel very much like it is own game.",1,1,31
"at first I was not going to buy the game, but I watched some of the videos on YouTube and I thought I might give it a go.",1,1,28
 I would say its definitely in my top 10 of simulation games which are by far my favorite.,1,1,18
"12 hours here,  over 70 hours",1,1,6
I ended up playing as a bounty hunter to which players would put real requests in the discord chat for other players to be taken out - This added a little element of haggling for a fair price for the time taken which I find to be a rewarding gameplay experience.,1,1,51
"I enjoyed the gunplay, I enjoyed all of the gear they give you",1,0,13
I enjoyed the little premise of each mission and map,1,0,10
I got a town and now I love this game,1,1,10
"if you are looking for the old PlayStation game theme hospital and you have looked everywhere, then stop now, you found it.",1,1,22
"it was fun while it lasted, I will keep it on my Wishlist for whenever, ",1,1,15
Maybe it's just because I aspire to be an astronomer and I love space but I would consider NMS to be my new favourite game.,1,1,25
Meanwhile other games of space-exploration genre are not even in the Goldilocks zone while they desperately try to now! ,1,1,19
"There will be tons of YouTube videos made in the future-to-come titled ""How Hello Games became one of the best after one of the worst game launches!""",1,1,27
NMS is not only one of the best spaces games ,1,1,10
it is one of the best life simulation and problem solving game.,1,1,12
sandbox mode is a delight when you want to decide that you want to play a specific hospital but with different rules.,1,1,22
"Some scenarios would I would recommend slow and methodical (using silencers, mirror wands, lock picks), whereas, others I recommend loud and proud (battering rams, stinger/flash grenades, C2). The choice is up to the player how they want to approach each situation.",1,1,41
seeing all these triggered people in the comments is so funny,1,0,11
john wick AI personally I think that they should slow the reflexes of the AI a bit because they snap on you so quick,1,1,24
but overall I def recommend this game!,1,1,7
"The game is amazing, even with all of the bugs and the I think playing it with other people is great.  ",1,1,21
the game is so outstanding and amazing with cool graphics and settings. ,1,1,12
"the details of the game keep me playing, non-stop.",1,1,9
"The single player is very well done with the team commands, but I prefer playing with friends to share the experience.",1,1,21
"the whole game is very cartoonish,  which is great for a lot of people.",1,1,14
"What do you have? To familiarize yourself with the game Ready or Not offers a Training Room from which you start missions, shoot yourself through a killhouse and get familiarized with Ready or Nots mechanics.",1,1,35
" where you can customize your loadout and your weapons,",1,1,9
"When a player settles down on a planet and makes a base, and the things they find there can become interesting just because of the connection to that procedural content.",1,1,30
" they start making an emotional investment in the base for all the time they've sunk into it,",1,1,17
"a game with better music-better controls (very subjective, I just really liked the controls of hospital and im not used to campus.",1,1,22
"yes, campus has honestly more content due to the different courses, but hospital was-funnier-more entertaining (radio and announcements)",1,1,18
 but the dj commentary and the ability to add your own music tracks definitely help make this game better. ,1,1,19
The random ailments the patients have are quite comical as well.,1,1,11
"during the start of the game it was fun, bouncing from location to location discovering new viruses and obtaining new rooms.",1,0,21
"Even if I had completed the game 100%, the updates that the developers had put out since the launch have fixed (in my experience) all the bugs and added SO MUCH content, features and additions to the game that it makes ",1,1,41
it worth buying now more than ever.,1,1,7
Game trailers showed a space game that rivalled or surpassed even the most epic space-based games on the market at the time.,1,1,22
"Gunplay is wonderful and realistic but has its flaws, ",1,1,9
"I am a huge fan of the old tactical classics like Rainbow Six and Swat 3 and 4, and ",1,1,19
this game is a true to the heart successor.,1,1,9
the characters interact with things in a much more satisfying way that in two point hospital and I love that their interactions teach them too.,1,1,25
"I hope the devs look at making an attack and defend type game mode comparable to Rainbow Six Siege, ",1,1,19
"I think that in time this game will gain some popularity on streaming sites such as twitch and YouTube and will become massive.""",1,1,23
"It is now my most favorite game in my Steam library, ",1,1,11
It motivates to replay the available missions and try different approaches. ,1,1,11
"Just gunning people down, or saving them or going with gas, then sneaky etc. Even if some playstyles aren't as viable or sometimes outright impossible, its still fun to try.",1,1,30
the game got a lot more polished to me,1,0,9
Overall this game has been a very enjoyable experience this was the first game I had to download.,1,1,18
"The team at Hello Games saved their reputation a few years ago when, despite the onslaught of negativity from fans, the press and observers alike, they committed themselves to deliver everything they had promised without charging for DLC.",1,1,38
This is a good game. One of the best ever made maybe. ,1,0,12
the fact remains that this game is not one of the world's most successful e-sports without reason.,1,0,17
This is the best all round game I've played to-date. ,1,1,10
"You can issue commands to your teammates pretty easily while moving dynamically through the map,  As with any game like this, it's a much better experience with friends.",1,1,28
and your AI companions are reasonable competent if issued the correct orders.,1,1,12
You play as SWAT and can either kill or save civilians and leave no witnesses to the violations of the Geneva Convention!!!!,1,1,22
"a lovely clean user interface that , user interface is what puts me off a lot of simulators but this game is beautiful.",1,1,23
is so easy to navigate,1,1,5
"the game is great, very funny, and more than decent tycoon.",1,1,11
"also, you can play while eating dinner only using a mouse, which is a big plus as lately we have this 30+°c weather and I cannot make myself use a keyboard to play anything.",1,1,34
"customisation of rooms seems to be practically endless due to the number of items in each, and the individuality of certain items.",1,1,22
Exploring the universe alongside friends or encountering other players' discoveries creates a sense of shared adventure and community.,1,1,18
Exploring the universe alongside friends or encountering other players' discoveries,1,1,10
 A graphic level without being a great game has adapted very well to the new times a level of gameplay is accessible to all types of players.,1,1,27
great game the game is really entertaining and retains the essence of hospital theme.,1,1,14
game is on par with games such as escape from Tarkov and Insurgency sandstorm,1,1,14
"Gun play feels amazing and , firing high powered weapons really gives you that punch feeling especially with ballistics being able to go through walls.",1,1,25
"may update this review later on, but overall as a experience for me I would give it a 3/5 so far. ",1,1,21
"pros:* easy to learn and play, even when you are tired.",1,1,11
"i have not completed the game yet but I have played it for a good amount of time, ",1,1,18
 the wait sure seems to be worth it more and more as I keep returning to the game.,1,1,18
"but it again isn't very immersive, usually it only requires you to hold s to auto-target you opponent and hold left mouse, sometimes letting go to cool your gun down so you don't overheat. It's quite simplistic.",1,1,37
"On the note of AI: Your AI teammates in single player are competent, as mentioned but they won’t carry you through the level, you still have to be careful, which is pretty manageable because you can give the AI pretty detailed orders.",1,1,42
"Playing this game with a mic is a MUST, communication is very important, this game made me buy a proper headset so I could communicate, ",1,1,25
simple UI. easy to understand but not easy enough for my interest to drop. ,1,1,14
"So far this game has a lot of potential, with the support of the mod community,",1,1,16
"the gunplay is almost flawless,",1,1,5
"The controls are intuitive, ",1,1,4
all in all this is the game that Siege should have been.,1,1,12
"even on the lower settings, the physics are good (if a bit funny when they bug out),",1,1,17
"The diverse and vibrant environments,",1,1,5
" coupled with a serene and atmospheric soundtrack,",1,1,7
 create an immersive and memorable experience.,1,1,6
"The environmental storytelling is top notch, and I often find myself very disturbed when paying attention to the little details in the maps.",1,1,23
RoN has made and balanced it in such a way that is easy to understand and sufficiently consistent.,1,1,18
"There is a story line and the ""general goal"" of the game is to get to the center of your galaxy (which is one of very many within the universe) , ",1,1,31
but remember to stop and explore some stuff on the way! Happy space sailing explorers!,1,1,15
"these games are so in-depth with multileveled puzzles, ",1,1,8
from real life and from the other games in the series... it just blows my mind.,1,1,16
This game ended up piquing my interest about the time Next arrived. I immediately became absorbed and played constantly for months on end.,1,1,23
"thoroughly enjoyed this game, a true continuations of tph. ",1,1,9
 my friends and I are taking screenshots and sharing them with each other all over the place.,1,1,17
"a fun hospital management simulator that makes what I like to call a good ""idle game,"" ",1,1,16
 the game still manages to get my curiosity going;,1,1,9
" either by exploring different planets to get more loot (to satisfy the little capitalist in me), ",1,1,16
but today it packs an incredible amount of content that ,1,1,10
finally lets you be the space explorer you want to be.,1,1,11
"But the play style is the key, there is no wrong way to play it, you just play it on your own pace, you are not punished for your way of playing so everyone just finds the way he/she likes to play it and enjoy it.",1,1,46
Easy to customize settings The game allows you to customize your settings very easily.,1,1,14
 So even if you run this game on a potato it's still playable.,1,1,13
"… I haven’t experienced any bugs,",1,1,6
" and if you liked theme hospital, you’ll love this as well.",1,1,11
"I started a new game, and it is so much smoother.",1,1,11
"I was excited for a sandbox universe,  who ",1,1,8
"heavily enjoyed bands like 65daysofstatic (who did a stellar job on the soundtrack, pun intended) .",1,1,16
if you do not already know it is a hospital simulation game. it is emphasis is more on its humorous aesthetics the strong gameplay mechanics.,1,1,25
"missing content tbh but that's to be expected now a days, overall that game has a huge potential as long as devs work hard on it and don't bail.",1,1,29
"No Man's Sky also offers a deep and rewarding progression system. Players can upgrade their starships, exosuits, and multi-tools, enhancing their capabilities and enabling them to venture further into the unknown.",1,1,31
"Otherwise, this game is extremely pleasant and fun with friends, ",1,1,10
"and definitely a game you should either have in your library, or your Wishlist.",1,1,14
the story length of the game extends further than one may think. ,1,1,12
"This is probably one of the best game to end the year, I have been waiting for RON for about 2 years and ",1,1,23
"You can customize your operator and if you are playing with AI, then you can customize them as well. Weapons have a good selection of attachments.",1,1,26
"All other game companies should be copying Hello Games response to their game releases, they didn’t give up when",1,1,19
", but it feels good because its like how dark souls is for me where the difficulty makes it fun",1,1,20
 this is an absolutely commendable and amazing game that addresses a lot of things I've wanted in a sci-fi game.,1,1,20
The sound of the engines roaring and the sight of the stars flashing by filled my senses as I soared through the cosmos.,1,1,23
"As the ship lifted off the ground, I could feel the weightlessness of space wash over me. ",1,1,17
"As you descend further down into the suspect's hideout, the music starts to get more tense until it culminates at the discovery of something truly horrifying (won't mention it here, play it for yourself).",1,1,34
"Besides, the game brings a good atmosphere in missions to players. Sometimes makes you breath rapidly  ",1,1,16
your squad maybe being attacked by enemies in a sudden. Make sure you are READY during missions.,1,1,17
but at bare minimum I have high respect for the developers for retaining their credibility through actions and not photo shopping a PR statement when making a huge mistake which seems to be the norm nowadays.,1,1,36
Great fun and lots memes to be made in Team kills.,1,1,11
"I really want to like this game, I 3 starred the majority of the universities and only 1 starred the final 4 universities out of curiosity to see how long it would take to effectively ""finish"" the game.",1,0,38
I would say that SWAT 4 had an overall noble tone of being protectors of the people who were going in and trying to save people and make the world better.,1,0,31
so a good blend of being able to play quickly but still having a learning curve down the road.,1,1,19
it was very easy to learn how to play the game but at the same time some of the challenges have been difficult,1,1,23
"I love this game, it is so fun and the fact that you can see your steam friends stats makes it a bit competitive, at least for me.",1,1,28
"mercy is not a required quality for this game, but capitalism is lol ",1,1,13
the game has a nice smooth gradual progression curve where ,1,1,10
"the first few levels serve both as tutorials in the short term, but are also replayable, since you can use your unlocks at previous hospitals.",1,1,25
 the movement is God tier,1,1,5
"the sound, the weapons is God tier",1,1,7
what really gets me is how absolutely tough and realistic the AI is.,1,1,13
"There is a powerful photo mode, and at almost any time during the game you could open the photo mode and take a really nice picture with minimal effort.",1,1,29
You can tackle an objective in so many different ways which allows you to replay the same mission over and over again and still feel fresh and exciting.,1,1,28
"... level design and graphics seem excellent, ",1,1,7
"so hopefully with a few patches and some serious AI tweaking... this could be the game me, 10-david and everyone else has been waiting for.",1,1,25
 there is enough to keep you busy for the duration learning about how things work.,1,1,15
"after building up two hospitals in the campaign mode and about 4-5 hours in,",1,1,14
"As for me, I would rather just choose a beautiful planet and chill out for a while. I've discovered a handful that are quite lovely and covered in stunning shimmering plants. This game has it all.",1,1,36
Gunplay is great,1,1,3
"I had played SWAT and before playing this I actually had a little familiarity, so when I tried the game I got the same sense from my past :D This game is awesome.",1,1,33
but the photo mode in this game is something I wish was in literally every other game.,1,1,17
New upgrade looks promising.,1,1,4
"Some people consider the AI response time to be too fast, but I think its perfect the way it is, ",1,1,20
it forces you to make split second decisions ,1,1,8
learn from the mistakes you've made in the past.,1,1,9
"The game also offers a variety of different modes, including single player and multiplayer,",1,1,14
the game is great  and I hope they make it workshop and online,1,1,13
"the humor in it is quite original, the voice acting is entertaining, and",1,1,13
 the best thing about it is that you can save it to the cloud and come back to it later.,1,1,20
"The soundtrack further enhances the sense of wonder and immersion, guiding players through their intergalactic journey with a beautiful and atmospheric score.",1,1,22
There are so many ways to play this game; there's something here for just about everyone. ,1,1,16
"There is a very few games these days, that would keep me playing through all of my free time, and absorb me to the point, where a few hours feels like a mere minutes. No Man's Sky is one of them.",1,1,41
"this game is super addicting and a whole lot of silly fun. the diseases, especially, will make you at least smack your forehead, if not straight-up laugh out loud.",1,1,29
but I think the devs could learn a bit from Escape From Tarkov,1,1,13
"This team of developers (remember the devs are not the ones that market and promote usually) has been dedicated, skilled, and made amazing choices in improving and enhancing this game.",1,1,30
"we can click and hold, we can click once for a menu and click pick up or sell, we can click and drag the mouse over an item to sweep it up quickly. Ease of editing.",1,1,36

but when I started to play my anxiety curiosity increased rapidly. ,1,1,11
"A quirky game with lots of fun things to do, so it seemed. it practically cures every of your illnesses.",1,1,20
deeply addicting random number generator synergy machine that provides streamlined roguelike experience as it stands it is primarily luck based which seems fitting for what this is,1,1,27

"From the voxel terrain editor, to the increasing amount of random events and locations to come across,",1,1,17
 you will never find yourself lacking incentive to continue exploring.,1,1,10
" I suspect that in the end I will want more to do - more scenarios, more facilities, more diseases to cure, and more challenge.",1,1,24
I expected this to be a one hell of a grind fest but with custom settings you can play it with your own terms which is perfect. This alone made me digging in and I love it.,1,1,37
"I have gotten through the first 2 levels, 3 stared both of them, and look forward to being able to come back later when I have completed more of the game/upgrades/achievements",1,1,31
"I only have one friend that plays the game, but every day we chat about new discoveries that we've made and adventures we've had. This game has honestly made me feel like a kid again.",1,1,35
"I used to keep a notepad on my phone that I updated before sleep to what I must do because it felt so satisfying to play that game, I didn't want to lose the momentum.",1,1,35
"it is pretty good for a micromanage game. if this was like zoo tycoon instead of a hospital theme I would praise it in an instant, or really anything more interesting than a hospital.",1,0,34
"let me tell you. Okay, the idea of managing a hospital is fantastic. ",1,0,13
I do not regret buying this the moment it came up for pre-order on their website.10/10,1,1,16
Highly recommended and ,1,1,3
"so if you like to play the numbers game, it will tickle your pickle. ",1,1,14
"Thank you Hello Games Supporting this game that’s been lost to the bigger publishers, and I’m so glad that this still happens here.",1,1,23
with so many good & FREE updates is something ,1,1,9
the game is the most realistic tac-FPS I have ever played and ,1,1,12
I would definitely recommend everyone to at least try this game out,1,1,12
this still in early acsess is crazy ,1,1,7
"The maps are very atmospheric, and for example my favourite, Neon Club, evokes feelings of almost eerie authenticity",1,1,18
 when a shooting actually occurs in a dance club in our world.,1,1,12

"but after about 2 hours of enjoying 5th or 6th level, game started to act… strange. icons above heads of patients wound not go away. as well as other “status” messages that popped stayed where they were. ",0,1,37
"this lasted about minute or two before I noticed and after this, framerate seemed to drop a lot. ",0,1,18
"The plants and animals often make no sense together. The plants don't have day/night cycles, and animals barely do. Geography is just height maps, no watersheds or erosion. The weather system barely makes sense. Whole planets are single or duo (water/land) biomes. ",0,0,42

"if you are looking for realism, ",0,1,6
"if there was one or two things I would add or ""tweak"" it would be just a bit more detail in the over-world map and the ability to zoom out a bit more to enjoy it by maybe 20-25%, but on scale for the entire game, that is more of a preference than an issue.",0,1,55
"So, you googled No Man's Sky and you read all the bad stuff that happened at launch: you think that the game is thrash, fair enough, it used to be this way.",0,1,32

"wandering past snack machines, toilets, showers, entertainments, with seemingly no goal in their mind.most of the challenges are fairly intuitive, though attractiveness goals again mostly involve spamming your campus with items that ruin any possible aesthetic you could have had and made me just want to finish that level and move on rather than stay and enjoy the university I would built up.",0,1,63
there is also an odd feeling I got from this game of a lot of the courses feeling samey and uninteresting in a way I never felt with two point hospital.,0,1,31
When you initiate some orders like deploy light stick the leader says nothing and the ai just drops the light stick. Are the using telepathy to communicate here this is not realistic and they need to fix this. They also need to use hand signal and also option to make the team hold or be able to break a command when the situation calls for it kind of like football and audibles.,0,1,72
They need the audio to be more random more audio files to randomly choose from so you get a more unique experience on every play through.,0,1,26
Why did the Chinese language disappear,0,0,6
"Why do I have to choose a taser over a handgun when many times an officer in the real world would likely have the option to have both? Why can't I have both an IR laser/Visible laser and a white light on my gun at the same time? Why does someone have the same amount of ammo with an SMG as a rifle (SMGs use smaller and lighter ammo, and smaller and lighter mags)? Why can't I add more or less mags/ammunition to my kit? Just small gripes that I think borrowing features from some other games could fix (Ground Branch kit and gun customization namely).",0,1,106

"i have found that the main complaint, pathfinding, can almost always be attributed to poor design/placement of walls/items. by realizing that people form a line at many places, example - reception, and if that line backs into any other line, example - vending machines, or object, examples - radiators/plants, they bug out. this is especially a problem in wards as where you put screens or plaster casters drastically impact how people move through the room.",0,1,75

I am disappointed in people who have bought this game.  I have never ever in my life seen such amount of people refusing to communicate in any other online game.",0,1,86
Random events or a series of progressive events that can only take place in certain game modes would make each run feel more tense and unsure of what to expect in each run.
